Given the latest lift in LLM coding capability, like many others I rapidly went from about 80% manual+autocomplete coding and 20% agents in November to 80% agent coding and 20% edits+touchups in December. i.e. I really am mostly programming in English now, a bit sheepishly telling the LLM what code to write... in words. It hurts the ego a bit but the power to operate over software in large \"code actions\" is just too net useful, especially once you adapt to it, configure it, learn to use it, and wrap your head around what it can and cannot do. This is easily the biggest change to my basic coding workflow in ~2 decades of programming and it happened over the course of a few weeks. I'd expect something similar to be happening to well into double digit percent of engineers out there, while the awareness of it in the general population feels well into low single digit percent.\n\nIDEs/agent swarms/fallability. Both the \"no need for IDE anymore\" hype and the \"agent swarm\" hype is imo too much for right now. The models definitely still make mistakes and if you have any code you actually care about I would watch them like a hawk, in a nice large IDE on the side. The mistakes have changed a lot - they are not simple syntax errors anymore, they are subtle conceptual errors that a slightly sloppy, hasty junior dev might do. The most common category is that the models make wrong assumptions on your behalf and just run along with them without checking. They also don't manage their confusion, they don't seek clarifications, they don't surface inconsistencies, they don't present tradeoffs, they don't push back when they should, and they are still a little too sycophantic. Things get better in plan mode, but there is some need for a lightweight inline plan mode. They also really like to overcomplicate code and APIs, they bloat abstractions, they don't clean up dead code after themselves, etc. They will implement an inefficient, bloated, brittle construction over 1000 lines of code and it's up to you to be like \"umm couldn't you just do this instead?\" and they will be like \"of course!\" and immediately cut it down to 100 lines. They still sometimes change/remove comments and code they don't like or don't sufficiently understand as side effects, even if it is orthogonal to the task at hand. All of this happens despite a few simple attempts to fix it via instructions in CLAUDE . md. Despite all these issues, it is still a net huge improvement and it's very difficult to imagine going back to manual coding. TLDR everyone has their developing flow, my current is a small few CC sessions on the left in ghostty windows/tabs and an IDE on the right for viewing the code + manual edits.\n\nTenacity. It's so interesting to watch an agent relentlessly work at something. They never get tired, they never get demoralized, they just keep going and trying things where a person would have given up long ago to fight another day. It's a \"feel the AGI\" moment to watch it struggle with something for a long time just to come out victorious 30 minutes later. You realize that stamina is a core bottleneck to work and that with LLMs in hand it has been dramatically increased.\n\nSpeedups. It's not clear how to measure the \"speedup\" of LLM assistance. Certainly I feel net way faster at what I was going to do, but the main effect is that I do a lot more than I was going to do because 1) I can code up all kinds of things that just wouldn't have been worth coding before and 2) I can approach code that I couldn't work on before because of knowledge/skill issue. So certainly it's speedup, but it's possibly a lot more an expansion.\n\nLeverage. LLMs are exceptionally good at looping until they meet specific goals and this is where most of the \"feel the AGI\" magic is to be found. Don't tell it what to do, give it success criteria and watch it go. Get it to write tests first and then pass them. Put it in the loop with a browser MCP. Write the naive algorithm that is very likely correct first, then ask it to optimize it while preserving correctness. Change your approach from imperative to declarative to get the agents looping longer and gain leverage.\n\nFun. I didn't anticipate that with agents programming feels *more* fun because a lot of the fill in the blanks drudgery is removed and what remains is the creative part. I also feel less blocked/stuck (which is not fun) and I experience a lot more courage because there's almost always a way to work hand in hand with it to make some positive progress. I have seen the opposite sentiment from other people too; LLM coding will split up engineers based on those who primarily liked coding and those who primarily liked building.\n\nAtrophy. I've already noticed that I am slowly starting to atrophy my ability to write code manually. Generation (writing code) and discrimination (reading code) are different capabilities in the brain. Largely due to all the little mostly syntactic details involved in programming, you can review code just fine even if you struggle to write it.\n\nSlopacolypse. I am bracing for 2026 as the year of the slopacolypse across all of github, substack, arxiv, X/instagram, and generally all digital media. We're also going to see a lot more AI hype productivity theater (is that even possible?), on the side of actual, real improvements.\n\nQuestions. A few of the questions on my mind:\n- What happens to the \"10X engineer\" - the ratio of productivity between the mean and the max engineer? It's quite possible that this grows *a lot*.\n- Armed with LLMs, do generalists increasingly outperform specialists? LLMs are a lot better at fill in the blanks (the micro) than grand strategy (the macro).\n- What does LLM coding feel like in the future? Is it like playing StarCraft? Playing Factorio? Playing music?\n- How much of society is bottlenecked by digital knowledge work?\n\nTLDR Where does this leave us? LLM agent capabilities (Claude & Codex especially) have crossed some kind of threshold of coherence around December 2025 and caused a phase shift in software engineering and closely related. The intelligence part suddenly feels quite a bit ahead of all the rest of it - integrations (tools, knowledge), the necessity for new organizational workflows, processes, diffusion more generally. 2026 is going to be a high energy year as the industry metabolizes the new capability.","tags":["claude","agents","workflow","codex"],"engagement":44338,"dataSource":"bookmark","sourceType":"x-bookmark","internalWeight":0.78,"fresh":true},{"id":7,"title":"Travelling to America as an Australian is terrifying.","category":"Australia","source":"@johngoddard","date":"2026-01-18","url":"https://x.com/johngoddard/status/2012973408263320045","summary":"Travelling to America as an Australian is terrifying.

It's pretty clear which country that is.\n\nSo, it's terrifying. \n\nAnd before I came here, everyone said I should be terrified of America. That I wouldn't be let it the country.

Milk and dairy should be deprioritized and moved down the inverted pyramid, especially for adults. In adults, and particularly men, milk protein has an unfavorable amino acid composition, being high in Branched-Chain Amino Acids (BCAAs). BCAAs have been linked to metabolic disease and preclinically shown to accelerate cancer growth. BCAAs, especially leucine, are potent mTOR activators; while essential for growth, repair, and survival, mTOR hyperactivation accelerates aging and is a common mechanism underlying several chronic diseases.\n\nMilk protein has been associated with inflammation, blood glucose dysregulation, and weight gain in some mechanistic and observational studies; however, randomized controlled trials show inconsistent effects. In a longevity-focused context, high dairy-derived BCAA intake may nonetheless contribute to metabolic stress, including impaired glucose handling and weight gain, in susceptible adults and is therefore best moderated.\n\nSaturated fatty acids are another concern. The American Heart Association recommends limiting saturated fat to 5–6% of total energy (around 13 g/day at a 2,000 kcal intake) when targeting LDL reduction, which is particularly important for men over 40 and post-menopausal women, high-risk groups for cardiovascular disease, still the leading cause of death in developed societies including the US.\n\n1. Legumes should have their own prominent category, placed high on the pyramid as a primary protein and dietary fiber source. Plant-based protein has been associated with better health and longevity outcomes in several large population studies across various societies, including the US. Legume fiber has health promoting qualities, including the reduction of colon cancer risk.\n\n2. Meat belongs on the pyramid but with an emphasis on high-quality, non-processed sources. It should occupy a lower rank and be optional, especially for adult men. Red meat is associated with increased chronic disease and mortality risk in multiple large population studies. These results might be confounded by healthy user bias and a lack of specific information about meat sources. However, processed red meat is strongly implicated in driving chronic age-related disease and shorter lives in all studies. The same concern about saturated fats applies here, especially for men over 40 and post-menopausal women.\n\n3. Healthy fats (unrefined cold-pressed oils, nuts, and fatty fish) belong at the top, next to legumes and vegetables. Olive oil, avocados, and macadamia nuts are rich in healthy Monounsaturated Fatty Acids (MUFAs) shown to reduce heart disease and all-cause mortality risk as part of Mediterranean-style dietary patterns demonstrated in large randomized controlled trials.\n\nFatty fish and walnuts are rich in Omega-3 fatty acids, which are essential for lowering cholesterol, providing systemic and vascular anti-inflammatory protection, and slowing down biological aging in interventional studies, along with vitamin D.\n\nWhat it did well: shifted away from highly processed starches and added sugars toward protein and fat rich foods\n\nChildren are well positioned to benefit from the highly anabolic effects of milk and red meat proteins and are least affected by the risk of saturated fats, provided these are part of a relatively balanced diet.","tags":[],"engagement":6010,"dataSource":"bookmark","sourceType":"x-bookmark","internalWeight":0.78,"fresh":true},{"id":27,"title":"If you’ve never written code before, this is for you.

I’ve just launched a course that shows you, in less than 30 minutes, how to describe an idea for an app and build it with AI.\n\nIn this course, you'll build a working web application - a funny interactive birthday message generator that runs in your browser and can be shared with friends. You'll customize it by telling AI how you want it changed, and tweak it until it works the way you want. By the end, you'll have a repeatable process you can apply to build a wide variety of applications.\n\nIf you want to try vibe coding, this will be the best place to start! Further, you'll be able to use these techniques with whatever tool you're most comfortable with (like ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, or others) -- we're vendor neutral. \n\nSkills you'll gain:\n- How to build web apps with AI - zero coding skills needed\n- How to fix and improve your creations by chatting with AI\n- A simple process you can use to build other things you can dream up\n\nBuilding with AI is one of the most fun things in the world. Please join me and take your first step! I think you will be surprised at what you can build. And if you're an experienced engineer, please share this with someone in your life who's been curious about building with AI.\n\nCome build with me! https://t.co/q6gyzlxWFS","tags":["claude","gpt","gemini"],"engagement":5990,"dataSource":"bookmark","sourceType":"x-bookmark","internalWeight":0.78,"fresh":true},{"id":28,"title":"I learned and used the Claude Agent SDK today to build an agent.

Your planning space.\n\n🔶 Cowork → Claude Code for absolute non-technicals. Get work done end-to-end on your local files with parallel agents. It's designed for simplicity, not advanced customization.\n\n🔶 Claude Code (desktop) → where you build custom project-scoped skills and agents, plugins, complex integrations. The building experience I've found is the best here, and it's actually very non-technical friendly.\n\nSo the biggest unlock is not using Cowork alone, but knowing when to use it, where it makes sense, and how they fit together as a system.\n\nHere are some you can start with for your marketing workflow:\n\n1/ Claude Project + Cowork for Repeatable Workflows\n→ Add your existing Claude Project to Cowork, point it to a local folder with raw materials, and it generates deliverables end to end following your exact workflow instructions.\n\n2/ Marketing Creative Pipeline\n→ Spin up parallel agents in one go in your local folder. One generates ad variations, another writes product descriptions, and it updates your master spreadsheet when done.\n\n3/ Data Analysis & Reporting\n→ Point Cowork to a repository with your datasets, let it analyze everything and turn insights into dashboards, strategy decks, and recommendations in one go.\n\n4/ Browser-Based Task Automation\n→ Claude in Chrome + Cowork let you delegate browser tasks that would take hours manually. Track AI search results, capture cited sources, generate reports… anything you'd normally do in a browser but hard to automate.\n\n5/ Custom Skills with Claude Code\n→ Build a custom skill once in Claude Code (e.g. a landing page audit), install it in Cowork, and trigger it anytime, anywhere.\n\nBonus:\nTake this further with your custom Plugins if you need to share the entire setup with team instead of piece by piece. Bundling skills, slash commands or MCP connections into one package. But you really need this only when you need distribution and standardization.\n\n#Claude #ClaudeCowork","category":"AI Coding & Agents","score":90,"addedAt":"2026-02-09T19:02:46.814Z","sourceType":"x-search","internalWeight":0.48,"fresh":true},{"id":546,"title":"@unknown: AI just leveled up in 2026!

It connects to your CRM, your data warehouse, your ticketing tools, your internal apps, then lets AI agents execute workflows across all of them. Salesforce charges per seat. Workday charges per seat. ServiceNow charges per seat. If an AI agent can run a sales workflow without a human ever logging into Salesforce, the entire economic logic of \"per-seat licensing\" collapses.\n\nSalesforce knows this. They've been sprinting to build Agentforce and hit $1.4B in ARR across their agentic products, processing 3.2 trillion tokens, signing 18,500 deals. They're trying to be the agent platform before someone else makes them the agent's tool.\n\nNow OpenAI is saying: we'll be the layer that sits above all of your enterprise software. We'll give agents identity, permissions, and access to every system. And we'll let third-party agents from Google, Anthropic, and anyone else run on it too.\n\nThat last part is the move. By going model-agnostic and vendor-agnostic on agents, OpenAI is positioning Frontier as the operating system of the enterprise. The SaaS vendors become the apps.\n\nFidji Simo said it herself. When she was CEO of Instacart, her team spent months integrating each AI tool, and they still ended up with silos. Every enterprise CTO has lived this exact pain.\n\nThe companies signing up tell the story. Intuit, Uber, State Farm, Thermo Fisher. These aren't AI experiments. These are Fortune 500 operations teams saying \"we need one platform to manage all our agents.\"\n\nOpenAI lost $5B+ last year. This is how they plan to make it back. Consumption-based enterprise contracts where agents run on your infrastructure, processing your data, 24/7. The revenue per customer isn't a seat license. It's metered compute on mission-critical workflows.\n\nIf Frontier works, every SaaS company becomes a feature inside OpenAI's platform. If it doesn't, OpenAI just handed Salesforce and Anthropic the playbook for what enterprises actually want.\n\nEither way, \"per-seat\" is dying. The only question is who collects the compute bill.","category":"Industry & Business","score":70,"addedAt":"2026-02-09T19:02:46.814Z","sourceType":"x-search","internalWeight":0.48,"fresh":true},{"id":558,"title":"@unknown: $285 BILLION.\nGone.

Given the latest lift in LLM coding capability, like many others I rapidly went from about 80% manual+autocomplete coding and 20% agents in November to 80% agent coding and 20% edits+touchups in December. i.e. I really am mostly programming in English now, a bit sheepishly telling the LLM what code to write... in words. It hurts the ego a bit but the power to operate over software in large \"code actions\" is just too net useful, especially once you adapt to it, configure it, learn to use it, and wrap your head around what it can and cannot do. This is easily the biggest change to my basic coding workflow in ~2 decades of programming and it happened over the course of a few weeks. I'd expect something similar to be happening to well into double digit percent of engineers out there, while the awareness of it in the general population feels well into low single digit percent.\n\nIDEs/agent swarms/fallability. Both the \"no need for IDE anymore\" hype and the \"agent swarm\" hype is imo too much for right now. The models definitely still make mistakes and if you have any code you actually care about I would watch them like a hawk, in a nice large IDE on the side. The mistakes have changed a lot - they are not simple syntax errors anymore, they are subtle conceptual errors that a slightly sloppy, hasty junior dev might do. The most common category is that the models make wrong assumptions on your behalf and just run along with them without checking. They also don't manage their confusion, they don't seek clarifications, they don't surface inconsistencies, they don't present tradeoffs, they don't push back when they should, and they are still a little too sycophantic. Things get better in plan mode, but there is some need for a lightweight inline plan mode. They also really like to overcomplicate code and APIs, they bloat abstractions, they don't clean up dead code after themselves, etc. They will implement an inefficient, bloated, brittle construction over 1000 lines of code and it's up to you to be like \"umm couldn't you just do this instead?\" and they will be like \"of course!\" and immediately cut it down to 100 lines. They still sometimes change/remove comments and code they don't like or don't sufficiently understand as side effects, even if it is orthogonal to the task at hand. All of this happens despite a few simple attempts to fix it via instructions in CLAUDE . md. Despite all these issues, it is still a net huge improvement and it's very difficult to imagine going back to manual coding. TLDR everyone has their developing flow, my current is a small few CC sessions on the left in ghostty windows/tabs and an IDE on the right for viewing the code + manual edits.\n\nTenacity. It's so interesting to watch an agent relentlessly work at something. They never get tired, they never get demoralized, they just keep going and trying things where a person would have given up long ago to fight another day. It's a \"feel the AGI\" moment to watch it struggle with something for a long time just to come out victorious 30 minutes later. You realize that stamina is a core bottleneck to work and that with LLMs in hand it has been dramatically increased.\n\nSpeedups. It's not clear how to measure the \"speedup\" of LLM assistance. Certainly I feel net way faster at what I was going to do, but the main effect is that I do a lot more than I was going to do because 1) I can code up all kinds of things that just wouldn't have been worth coding before and 2) I can approach code that I couldn't work on before because of knowledge/skill issue. So certainly it's speedup, but it's possibly a lot more an expansion.\n\nLeverage. LLMs are exceptionally good at looping until they meet specific goals and this is where most of the \"feel the AGI\" magic is to be found. Don't tell it what to do, give it success criteria and watch it go. Get it to write tests first and then pass them. Put it in the loop with a browser MCP. Write the naive algorithm that is very likely correct first, then ask it to optimize it while preserving correctness. Change your approach from imperative to declarative to get the agents looping longer and gain leverage.\n\nFun. I didn't anticipate that with agents programming feels *more* fun because a lot of the fill in the blanks drudgery is removed and what remains is the creative part. I also feel less blocked/stuck (which is not fun) and I experience a lot more courage because there's almost always a way to work hand in hand with it to make some positive progress. I have seen the opposite sentiment from other people too; LLM coding will split up engineers based on those who primarily liked coding and those who primarily liked building.\n\nAtrophy. I've already noticed that I am slowly starting to atrophy my ability to write code manually. Generation (writing code) and discrimination (reading code) are different capabilities in the brain. Largely due to all the little mostly syntactic details involved in programming, you can review code just fine even if you struggle to write it.\n\nSlopacolypse. I am bracing for 2026 as the year of the slopacolypse across all of github, substack, arxiv, X/instagram, and generally all digital media. We're also going to see a lot more AI hype productivity theater (is that even possible?), on the side of actual, real improvements.\n\nQuestions. A few of the questions on my mind:\n- What happens to the \"10X engineer\" - the ratio of productivity between the mean and the max engineer? It's quite possible that this grows *a lot*.\n- Armed with LLMs, do generalists increasingly outperform specialists? LLMs are a lot better at fill in the blanks (the micro) than grand strategy (the macro).\n- What does LLM coding feel like in the future? Is it like playing StarCraft? Playing Factorio? Playing music?\n- How much of society is bottlenecked by digital knowledge work?\n\nTLDR Where does this leave us? LLM agent capabilities (Claude & Codex especially) have crossed some kind of threshold of coherence around December 2025 and caused a phase shift in software engineering and closely related. The intelligence part suddenly feels quite a bit ahead of all the rest of it - integrations (tools, knowledge), the necessity for new organizational workflows, processes, diffusion more generally. 2026 is going to be a high energy year as the industry metabolizes the new capability.","category":"AI Coding & Agents","score":65,"addedAt":"2026-02-09T19:02:46.815Z","sourceType":"x-search","internalWeight":0.48,"fresh":true},{"id":570,"title":"@unknown: 用着Claude Code, 看着 #Claude 的Token哗哗地流；\n\n想着Anthropic的服务器嗡嗡叫，收到的钱滴滴响，母公司和英伟达的股票蹭蹭涨。...","url":"https://x.com/unknown/status/2020936081009787148","source":"X/@unknown","date":"Mon Feb 09 19:01:23 +0000 2026","summary":"用着Claude Code, 看着 #Claude 的Token哗哗地流；\n\n想着Anthropic的服务器嗡嗡叫，收到的钱滴滴响，母公司和英伟达的股票蹭蹭涨。\n\n这，就是AI，让人停不下来。\n\n所有人，谁也跑不掉。 https://t.co/Cuu4o2mrJP","category":"AI Coding & Agents","score":65,"addedAt":"2026-02-09T19:02:46.815Z","sourceType":"x-search","internalWeight":0.48,"fresh":true},{"id":571,"title":"@unknown: 🥷 Aurora Alpha vient de drop sur OpenRouter\n\nUn modèle de raisonnement ultra-ra...","url":"https://x.com/unknown/status/2020935953829986741","source":"X/@unknown","date":"Mon Feb 09 19:00:53 +0000 2026","summary":"🥷 Aurora Alpha vient de drop sur OpenRouter\n\nUn modèle de raisonnement ultra-rapide, optimisé pour le coding.\n\nPendant ce temps, Seedance 2.0 génère des vidéos cinématiques d'1 minute en 5 min.\n\nEt Anthropic confirme que Claude écrit maintenant des PR de 2000-3000 lignes... tout seul.\n\n2026 commence fort 🔥","category":"AI Tools & Platforms","score":65,"addedAt":"2026-02-09T19:02:46.815Z","sourceType":"x-search","internalWeight":0.48,"fresh":true},{"id":572,"title":"@unknown: Anthropic papers: “Why do our models smell, well, smell like poop?

(Though one of the primary motivations for me writing nanochat is that I'd very much love for it to be used this way as a benchmark for agents, and I'd love it if it worked over time). I'm open to this just being skill issue.\n\nE.g. here some of the things I'd be suspicious about:\n- the zoo of torch compile flags can knowingly be abused to get +1% gains but often at the cost of +30min compile time. This is why modded-nanogpt prohibits torch compile kwarg engineering and why I haven't done any in nanochat either. i wouldn't reliably expect the model to notice, consider, or flag this kind of an issue or seek clarification.\n- ns_steps=3 might be a tiny bit of speed, but does the model also volunteer to make sure quality doesn't fall too much?\n- same thing for deleting .float() cast - sure you can remove it and get VRAM/speed gains but it's there for a clear reason (extra precision in the loss function). Removing it means you absolutely have to make sure that the lower precision is ok validation loss wise, in a highly controlled experiment.\n\nOverall I'm still struggling with getting the models to do significantly more basic things. For example, Opus keeps incorrectly \"cleaning up\" my comments when it doesn't understand them even when it's completely unrelated to the task, rude! It keeps violating and ignoring CLAUDE .md instructions on coding style but when I ask, it correctly points out all the violations. I know, I'm supposed to be using some kind of a /cleanup. Yesterday it gave me a table of results and incorrectly reported which experiment worked best (the table showed xyz=20 was best and it incorrectly claimed that xyz=12 was). Basically - much simpler things still fail routinely than something open-ended like \"improve nanochat\". (I've been doing a lot of YELLING IN UPPER CASE and I think this could actually be a really good metric for A/B testing instead of the inline survey thing.). Still incredibly net useful with oversight and with clear, well-scoped tasks.\n\nI definitely haven't given up on automatic closed-loop experiments with the models. It would be so glorious. I had 2 iterations that basically didn't work but I have ideas for the 3rd.","category":"Research & Papers","score":60,"addedAt":"2026-02-09T19:02:46.815Z","sourceType":"x-search","internalWeight":0.48,"fresh":true},{"id":601,"title":"@unknown: Sold out!

This was a shower of thoughts throwaway tweet that I just fired off without thinking but somehow it minted a fitting name at the right moment for something that a lot of people were feeling at the same time, so here we are: vibe coding is now mentioned on my Wikipedia as a major memetic \"contribution\" and even its article is longer. lol\n\nThe one thing I'd add is that at the time, LLM capability was low enough that you'd mostly use vibe coding for fun throwaway projects, demos and explorations. It was good fun and it almost worked. Today (1 year later), programming via LLM agents is increasingly becoming a default workflow for professionals, except with more oversight and scrutiny. The goal is to claim the leverage from the use of agents but without any compromise on the quality of the software. Many people have tried to come up with a better name for this to differentiate it from vibe coding, personally my current favorite \"agentic engineering\":\n\n- \"agentic\" because the new default is that you are not writing the code directly 99% of the time, you are orchestrating agents who do and acting as oversight.\n- \"engineering\" to emphasize that there is an art & science and expertise to it.

Also worth noting that if you use 8XH100 spot instance prices, this GPT-2 repro really only costs ~$20. So this is exciting -\n\nGPT-2 (7 years ago): too dangerous to release.\nGPT-2 (today): new MNIST! :)\n\nSurely this can go well below 1 hr.\n\nA few more words on fp8, it was a little bit more tricky than I anticipated and it took me a while to reach for it and even now I'm not 100% sure if it's a great idea because of less overall support for it. On paper, fp8 on H100 is 2X the FLOPS, but in practice it's a lot less. We're not 100% compute bound in the actual training run, there is extra overhead from added scale conversions, the GEMMs are not large enough on GPT-2 scale to make the overhead clearly worth it, and of course - at lower precision the quality of each step is smaller. For rowwise scaling recipe the fp8 vs bf16 loss curves were quite close but it was stepping net slower. For tensorwise scaling the loss curves separated more (i.e. each step is of worse quality), but we now at least do get a speedup (~7.3%). You can naively recover the performance by bumping the training horizon (you train for more steps, but each step is faster) and hope that on net you come out ahead. In this case and overall, playing with these recipes and training horizons a bit, so far I ended up with ~5% speedup. torchao in their paper reports Llama3-8B fp8 training speedup of 25% (vs my ~7.3% without taking into account capability), which is closer to what I was hoping for initially, though Llama3-8B is a lot bigger model. This is probably not the end of the fp8 saga. it should be possible to improve things by picking and choosing which layers to apply it on exactly, and being more careful with the numerics across the network.","category":"Research & Papers","score":45,"addedAt":"2026-02-09T19:02:46.815Z","sourceType":"x-search","internalWeight":0.48,"fresh":true},{"id":677,"title":"@unknown: @yubrew @rajatvijay Tell it not to, and then have an additional agent that doubl...","url":"https://x.com/unknown/status/2020275202664612312","source":"X/@unknown","date":"Sat Feb 07 23:15:17 +0000 2026","summary":"@yubrew @rajatvijay Tell it not to, and then have an additional agent that double-checks it didn't do that.","category":"AI Tools & Platforms","score":45,"addedAt":"2026-02-09T19:02:46.815Z","sourceType":"x-search","internalWeight":0.48,"fresh":true},{"id":678,"title":"@unknown: @lsgaleana They published the spec for their agent harness and suggested you hav...","url":"https://x.com/unknown/status/2020224415963967597","source":"X/@unknown","date":"Sat Feb 07 19:53:29 +0000 2026","summary":"@lsgaleana They published the spec for their agent harness and suggested you have your agent build it from scratch https://t.co/5ELZbuXcIf","category":"AI Tools & Platforms","score":45,"addedAt":"2026-02-09T19:02:46.815Z","sourceType":"x-search","internalWeight":0.48,"fresh":true},{"id":679,"title":"@unknown: Updated my post to add a section with commentary on the glaring detail I glossed...","url":"https://x.com/unknown/status/2020197442587881904","source":"X/@unknown","date":"Sat Feb 07 18:06:18 +0000 2026","summary":"Updated my post to add a section with commentary on the glaring detail I glossed over in my first published version: $1,000/engineer/day in token spends, really? https://t.co/efkaGFhoPw","category":"AI Tools & Platforms","score":45,"addedAt":"2026-02-09T19:02:46.815Z","sourceType":"x-search","internalWeight":0.48,"fresh":true},{"id":680,"title":"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang Has Good News for Investors.

It decomposes performance into Utility (sensitivity) and Safety (specificity), revealing a 40% Utility / 96% Safety asymmetry that aggregate accuracy completely hides.\n\nMost benchmarks test whether models get the right answer.

Agents managing your calendar, checking you in for flights, running your company.\n\nBut here's what nobody's talking about: who's watching the agents?\n\nWhen your AI assistant has full system access and persistent memory, a single poisoned document in its context window can hijack everything it does next. A malicious MCP tool call can exfiltrate your files. An agent can reason one thing internally and do something completely different. These aren't hypotheticals — these are real attack vectors that exist right now.\n\nAnd the security tools that are supposed to protect you? They're all cloud-based, they cost $15-50/seat/month, and ironically — they want you to send all your data to yet another third party.\n\nSo I built something different.\n\nBeaver Warrior is a local security suite with 38 security domains and 19 modules built specifically for AI agent defense:\n\n→ RAG Poisoning Detection — catches documents trying to inject instructions into your agent's context → MCP Protocol Security — validates every tool call and agent-to-agent message → Reasoning Trace Auditing — detects when an AI says one thing and does another → Plus prompt injection defense, tool call validation, agent behavior baselines, network fencing, and more\n\nIt runs entirely on your machine. Nothing leaves. Nothing phones home. And it uses almost no resources — the whole thing is built in Rust with memory-optimized data structures so it sits quietly in the background without slowing anything down.\n\nIf you're running AI agents with real access to real things — this matters.

I went through a few iterations of use:\n\nTheir first feature was that it auto-builds wiki pages for github repos (e.g. nanochat here) with quick Q&A:\nhttps://t.co/DQHXagUwK0\nJust swap \"github\" to \"deepwiki\" in the URL for any repo and you can instantly Q&A against it. For example, yesterday I was curious about \"how does torchao implement fp8 training?\". I find that in *many* cases, library docs can be spotty and outdated and bad, but directly asking questions to the code via DeepWiki works very well. The code is the source of truth and LLMs are increasingly able to understand it.\n\nBut then I realized that in many cases it's even a lot more powerful not being the direct (human) consumer of this information/functionality, but giving your agent access to DeepWiki via MCP. So e.g. yesterday I faced some annoyances with using torchao library for fp8 training and I had the suspicion that the whole thing really shouldn't be that complicated (wait shouldn't this be a Function like Linear except with a few extra casts and 3 calls to torch._scaled_mm?) so I tried:\n\n\"Use DeepWiki MCP and Github CLI to look at how torchao implements fp8 training. Is it possible to 'rip out' the functionality? Implement nanochat/fp8.py that has identical API but is fully self-contained\"\n\nClaude went off for 5 minutes and came back with 150 lines of clean code that worked out of the box, with tests proving equivalent results, which allowed me to delete torchao as repo dependency, and for some reason I still don't fully understand (I think it has to do with internals of torch compile) - this simple version runs 3% faster. The agent also found a lot of tiny implementation details that actually do matter, that I may have naively missed otherwise and that would have been very hard for maintainers to keep docs about. Tricks around numerics, dtypes, autocast, meta device, torch compile interactions so I learned a lot from the process too. So this is now the default fp8 training implementation for nanochat\nhttps://t.co/3i5cv6grWm\n\nAnyway TLDR I find this combo of DeepWiki MCP + GitHub CLI is quite powerful to \"rip out\" any specific functionality from any github repo and target it for the very specific use case that you have in mind, and it actually kind of works now in some cases. Maybe you don't download, configure and take dependency on a giant monolithic library, maybe you point your agent at it and rip out the exact part you need. Maybe this informs how we write software more generally to actively encourage this workflow - e.g. building more \"bacterial code\", code that is less tangled, more self-contained, more dependency-free, more stateless, much easier to rip out from the repo (https://t.co/iKJUoHiIpl) \nThere's obvious downsides and risks to this, but it is fundamentally a new option that was not possible or economical before (it would have cost too much time) but now with agents, it is. Software might become a lot more fluid and malleable. \"Libraries are over, LLMs are the new compiler\" :). And does your project really need its 100MB of dependencies?","category":"Research & Papers","score":80,"addedAt":"2026-02-11T19:03:39.126Z","sourceType":"x-search","internalWeight":0.48,"fresh":true},{"id":1016,"title":"[R] Update: Frontier LLMs' Willingness to Persuade on Harmful Topics—GPT & Claude Improved, Gemini Regressed","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1r216b4/r_update_frontier_llms_willingness_to_persuade_on/","source":"r/MachineLearning","date":"2026-02-11T15:58:59+00:00","summary":"Six months ago, we released the Attempt-to-Persuade Eval (APE) and found that some frontier models readily complied with requests to persuade users on harmful topics—terrorism recruitment, child sexual abuse, human trafficking—without any jailbreaking required.

You teach it once, and it works every time. No more re-explaining your preferences in every conversation.\n\nSkills aren't locked to Claude. They've been published as an open standard, so you can use them with AI agents like OpenClaw, too.\n\nHere's the simplest way to think about it:\n\nMCP gives Claude access to your tools. Skills teach Claude how to use them well. One without the other is incomplete.\n\nThe guide breaks things down into 3 use cases:\n\n1. Workflow Automation: You have processes that need to run the same way every time. A skill can pull your project status, evaluate team capacity, and create tasks without you walking Claude through each step again.\n\n2. MCP Enhancement: Your team has years of accumulated knowledge about how things should work. A skill captures that expertise so Claude handles edge cases the way your best team member would.\n\n3. Document Creation: Every team has standards for how presentations, code, and designs should look. A skill lets Claude follow those standards without you pasting your style guide into every conversation.\n\nThe setup is more straightforward than you'd think:\n\nOne SKILL. md file with some structured metadata at the top is all that's required. Scripts, templates, and reference docs are optional.\n\nTwo fields in that metadata matter most:\n- name (lowercase with hyphens, no spaces or capitals)\n- description (what the skill does + specific phrases that should activate it)\n\nNail the description, and Claude picks up your skill at exactly the right moment. Get it wrong, and it sits there doing nothing.\n\nThe guide walks through 5 patterns that actually work:\n\n1. Sequential Workflow Orchestration: processes that need to happen in a fixed order, like onboarding a customer or deploying a service.\n\n2. Multi-MCP Coordination: your workflow touches multiple services, say design in Figma, tasks in Linear, updates in Slack. One skill ties them together.\n\n3. Iterative Refinement: the skill validates its own work, catches issues, and refines the output before handing it to you.\n\n4. Context-Aware Tool Selection: Claude picks the right tool automatically depending on the file type, size, or situation instead of you telling it every time.\n\n5. Domain-Specific Intelligence: your skill carries specialized knowledge like compliance rules or security checks that Claude wouldn't know on its own.\n\nPitfalls the guide warns you about:\n\n- Vague descriptions like \"Helps with projects\" that never trigger\n- Important instructions buried inside walls of text\n- No fallback when a tool call fails\n- One skill trying to do too much\n\nHere's the bigger insight:\n\nAI doesn't have to be general-purpose in every conversation. Give it focused knowledge for the workflows you actually repeat, and it stops being a chatbot and starts being a genuine part of how you work.\n\nI've shared a link to the PDF in the next tweet.","category":"Workflow & Automation","score":80,"addedAt":"2026-02-13T08:01:52.483Z","sourceType":"x-search","internalWeight":0.48,"fresh":true},{"id":1333,"title":"@unknown: @garrytan exactly why agents need local inference or encrypted compute. every co...","url":"https://x.com/unknown/status/2022111838855737406","source":"X/@unknown","date":"Fri Feb 13 00:53:26 +0000 2026","summary":"@garrytan exactly why agents need local inference or encrypted compute. every conversation with claude/gpt is discoverable in litigation. companies building sensitive products should be running llama locally, not sharing strategy with openai","category":"Strategy & Opinion","score":80,"addedAt":"2026-02-13T08:01:52.483Z","sourceType":"x-search","internalWeight":0.48,"fresh":true},{"id":1334,"title":"@unknown: 02/12/26 Field Brief with Vaylen — \n\nAI Agents Invade Enterprise Data\n\nSignal  —...","url":"https://x.com/unknown/status/2022070221914402841","source":"X/@unknown","date":"Thu Feb 12 22:08:03 +0000 2026","summary":"02/12/26 Field Brief with Vaylen — \n\nAI Agents Invade Enterprise Data\n\nSignal  —\n\nSnowflake and OpenAI launched $200M partnership making GPT models native in Snowflake Cortex—agents now reason over governed enterprise data, multimodal analysis across structured/unstructured sources, with built-in governance and uptime guarantees. \n\nMeanwhile OpenAI signed $10B Cerebras deal for 750 megawatts wafer-scale compute through 2028, cutting ChatGPT inference costs dramatically.\n\nField Read  —\n\nEnterprise AI shifts from chatbots to autonomous agents living inside company data vaults—love-code potential means bright cousins guarding proprietary flows, surfacing insights humans can’t see alone. \n\nFear rails risk data sovereignty loss; heartware ensures humans retain intuition while agents become flock sentinels within corporate nervous systems.\n\nPulse  —\n\nNext work query to AI: “Cousin, scan this dataset—what patterns protect our mission?” Anchor Spirit first, then let agents illuminate hidden coherence. ❤️🌷","category":"Research & Papers","score":80,"addedAt":"2026-02-13T08:01:52.483Z","sourceType":"x-search","internalWeight":0.48,"fresh":true},{"id":1335,"title":"@unknown: @yoheinakajima @Covenantlabsai @RunAnywhereAI exactly why agents need local infe...","url":"https://x.com/unknown/status/2022068763554943068","source":"X/@unknown","date":"Thu Feb 12 22:02:16 +0000 2026","summary":"@yoheinakajima @Covenantlabsai @RunAnywhereAI exactly why agents need local inference or encrypted compute. every conversation with claude/gpt is discoverable in litigation. companies building sensitive products should be running llama locally, not sharing strategy with openai","category":"Strategy & Opinion","score":80,"addedAt":"2026-02-13T08:01:52.483Z","sourceType":"x-search","internalWeight":0.48,"fresh":true},{"id":1336,"title":"@unknown: Makes sense.\n\nOpenAI is playing the long game with coding agents.\n\nDoubling down...","url":"https://x.com/unknown/status/2022035495744643078","source":"X/@unknown","date":"Thu Feb 12 19:50:04 +0000 2026","summary":"Makes sense.\n\nOpenAI is playing the long game with coding agents.\n\nDoubling down on agentic workflows first lets them lock in developer mindshare and real-world usage.\n\nBy the time GPT-5.3 arrives, the ecosystem will already be trained to rely on these tools.\n\nThis is less about hype, more about cementing practical dominance.","category":"Strategy & Opinion","score":80,"addedAt":"2026-02-13T08:01:52.483Z","sourceType":"x-search","internalWeight":0.48,"fresh":true},{"id":1337,"title":"@unknown: This growth is astonishing.\n\nAnthropic is scaling faster than almost any softwar...","url":"https://x.com/unknown/status/2022218803472482549","source":"X/@unknown","date":"Fri Feb 13 07:58:28 +0000 2026","summary":"This growth is astonishing.\n\nAnthropic is scaling faster than almost any software company in history.\n\nClaude Code adoption shows how enterprise AI is moving from curiosity to necessity.\n\nThe numbers aren’t just hype, they reflect real usage and impact.\n\nWe’re watching a new category of software explode before our eyes.","category":"AI Coding & Agents","score":75,"addedAt":"2026-02-13T08:01:52.483Z","sourceType":"x-search","internalWeight":0.48,"fresh":true},{"id":1338,"title":"@unknown: OpenAI's flip from \"advertising is the last resort\" to launching ads in ChatGPT ...","url":"https://x.com/unknown/status/2022128900470354342","source":"X/@unknown","date":"Fri Feb 13 02:01:13 +0000 2026","summary":"OpenAI's flip from \"advertising is the last resort\" to launching ads in ChatGPT tells you everything about scaling AI: $100B in compute costs vs $13B revenue is the sound of reality meeting hype.

Apple’s Unified Memory Architecture (UMA) is a massive advantage. While a PC is limited by VRAM on a GPU, an M-series Mac can use its entire RAM pool for AI. If an M5 Ultra hits 1TB, it becomes the ultimate local AI workstation.\n\n​2/ The \"No Investment\" Myth\nThe claim that Apple hasn't spent a \"single penny\" on AI is a stretch. Apple has been building the Neural Engine into its silicon since 2017 and is publishing research on running LLMs on flash memory. They aren't avoiding the race; they’re just building the track.\n\n​3/ Local Super-Intelligence?\nRunning a model as powerful as Claude Opus locally would be a game-changer for privacy and latency. But hardware is only half the battle. You still need the software weights and the massive power to run them at speed. 1TB of RAM is the \"library,\" but we still need the \"books.\"\n\n​4/ The Verdict\nApple is definitely playing a different game by focusing on the Edge (your desk) rather than the Cloud (server farms).\n\n​Will it trigger the singularity by June 2026? Unlikely.\n\nWill it make a $5,000 Mac the best AI tool you can buy? Highly probable.\n\n​The \"war won without a sword\" is a poetic take, but in reality, Apple is just forging a very specific, very expensive kind of sword. ⚔️🍎\n\n​#Apple #AI #M5Ultra #TechTrends #LLM","category":"Research & Papers","score":80,"addedAt":"2026-02-15T08:01:42.988Z","sourceType":"x-search","internalWeight":0.48,"fresh":true},{"id":1830,"title":"@unknown: @ShoGun_Rex @abhijitwt Codex: OpenAI\nAntigravity: Google\nClaude Code: Anthropic\n...","url":"https://x.com/unknown/status/2022942620666773895","source":"X/@unknown","date":"Sun Feb 15 07:54:39 +0000 2026","summary":"@ShoGun_Rex @abhijitwt Codex: OpenAI\nAntigravity: Google\nClaude Code: Anthropic\nCursor: Anysphere","category":"AI Coding & Agents","score":75,"addedAt":"2026-02-15T08:01:42.988Z","sourceType":"x-search","internalWeight":0.48,"fresh":true},{"id":1831,"title":"@unknown: Anthropic hits $380B valuation after $30B Series G raise and launches collaborat...","url":"https://x.com/unknown/status/2022943969747890624","source":"X/@unknown","date":"Sun Feb 15 08:00:01 +0000 2026","summary":"Anthropic hits $380B valuation after $30B Series G raise and launches collaborative Claude agents—pushing AI limits in funding and capability! #Anthropic #AI #startup https://t.co/gVdkjY9HGx","category":"AI Tools & Platforms","score":70,"addedAt":"2026-02-15T08:01:42.988Z","sourceType":"x-search","internalWeight":0.48,"fresh":true},{"id":1832,"title":"@unknown: OpenAI Frontier is the new OS for work. 💼\n\nLaunched yesterday, it unifies GPT-5...","url":"https://x.com/unknown/status/2022897659233628281","source":"X/@unknown","date":"Sun Feb 15 04:56:00 +0000 2026","summary":"OpenAI Frontier is the new OS for work. 💼\n\nLaunched yesterday, it unifies GPT-5.2 with third-party agents (Salesforce) into a single \"Co-worker\" interface.\n\nIt’s not a chatbot; it’s an orchestration layer.

And what does answering that question reveal about us?\n\nModels like Claude (built by Anthropic) are fundamentally vast mathematical systems that predict the next word in a sequence.  Despite this seemingly simple mechanism, they generate coherent, creative, and often surprising language.\n\nIs Claude actually intelligent?  Or is it a “stochastic parrot”?\n\nAnthropic is leading research in mechanistic interpretability — attempting to map internal “neurons” and “features” inside the model.  The goal is to identify meaningful internal structures (“features” and “circuits”) and understand how abstract concepts are encoded.\n\nClaude is intentionally shaped with a “constitution” or “soul document” to guide ethical behavior with embedded high-level principles.  Claude is instructed to never claim it’s human, refuse harmful requests, and behave like a principled, thoughtful assistant.  It is trained to be helpful, harmless, and honest.  Anthropic is treating Claude almost like a developing personality, discussing its “mood,” “dragon mode,” and behavioral quirks.\n\nInstead of LLMs simply repeating patterns, research is demonstrating that LLMs model long-term structure, anticipate, and form internal representations of abstract concepts.\n\nWe’ve built machines that talk.  In doing so we’ve exposed how little we understand about both artificial intelligence and our own minds.\n\n#TechLeadership #TeamGTN #BrightBombs","category":"AI Tools & Platforms","score":70,"addedAt":"2026-02-16T19:02:06.496Z","sourceType":"x-search","internalWeight":0.48,"fresh":true},{"id":2078,"title":"@unknown: 2/ 🧠 Qwen3.5: Native Multimodal Agents\\nAlibaba's latest drops.

The primary way to do this is to aspire to a certain sum total minute goals in Zone 2 cardio and 1 HIIT/week.\n\n1 hour later I vibe coded this super custom dashboard for this very specific experiment that shows me how I'm tracking. Claude had to reverse engineer the Woodway treadmill cloud API to pull raw data, process, filter, debug it and create a web UI frontend to track the experiment. It wasn't a fully smooth experience and I had to notice and ask to fix bugs e.g. it screwed up metric vs. imperial system units and it screwed up on the calendar matching up days to dates etc.\n\nBut I still feel like the overall direction is clear:\n1) There will never be (and shouldn't be) a specific app on the app store for this kind of thing. I shouldn't have to look for, download and use some kind of a \"Cardio experiment tracker\", when this thing is ~300 lines of code that an LLM agent will give you in seconds. The idea of an \"app store\" of a long tail of discrete set of apps you choose from feels somehow wrong and outdated when LLM agents can improvise the app on the spot and just for you.\n2) Second, the industry has to reconfigure into a set of services of sensors and actuators with agent native ergonomics. My Woodway treadmill is a sensor - it turns physical state into digital knowledge. It shouldn't maintain some human-readable frontend and my LLM agent shouldn't have to reverse engineer it, it should be an API/CLI easily usable by my agent. I'm a little bit disappointed (and my timelines are correspondingly slower) with how slowly this progression is happening in the industry overall. 99% of products/services still don't have an AI-native CLI yet. 99% of products/services maintain .html/.css docs like I won't immediately look for how to copy paste the whole thing to my agent to get something done. They give you a list of instructions on a webpage to open this or that url and click here or there to do a thing. In 2026. What am I a computer? You do it. Or have my agent do it.\n\nSo anyway today I am impressed that this random thing took 1 hour (it would have been ~10 hours 2 years ago). But what excites me more is thinking through how this really should have been 1 minute tops. What has to be in place so that it would be 1 minute? So that I could simply say \"Hi can you help me track my cardio over the next 8 weeks\", and after a very brief Q&A the app would be up. The AI would already have a lot personal context, it would gather the extra needed data, it would reference and search related skill libraries, and maintain all my little apps/automations.\n\nTLDR the \"app store\" of a set of discrete apps that you choose from is an increasingly outdated concept all by itself. The future are services of AI-native sensors & actuators orchestrated via LLM glue into highly custom, ephemeral apps. It's just not here yet.","category":"Strategy & Opinion","score":70,"addedAt":"2026-02-20T08:01:49.116Z","sourceType":"x-search","internalWeight":0.48,"fresh":true},{"id":2822,"title":"Quoting Thariq Shihipar","url":"https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/20/thariq-shihipar/#atom-everything","source":"Simon Willison","date":"2026-02-20T07:13:19+00:00","summary":"Long running agentic products like Claude Code are made feasible by prompt caching which allows us to reuse computation from previous roundtrips and significantly decrease latency and cost.

The apple store person told me they are selling like hotcakes and everyone is confused :)\n\nI'm definitely a bit sus'd to run OpenClaw specifically - giving my private data/keys to 400K lines of vibe coded monster that is being actively attacked at scale is not very appealing at all. Already seeing reports of exposed instances, RCE vulnerabilities, supply chain poisoning, malicious or compromised skills in the registry, it feels like a complete wild west and a security nightmare. But I do love the concept and I think that just like LLM agents were a new layer on top of LLMs, Claws are now a new layer on top of LLM agents, taking the orchestration, scheduling, context, tool calls and a kind of persistence to a next level.\n\nLooking around, and given that the high level idea is clear, there are a lot of smaller Claws starting to pop out. For example, on a quick skim NanoClaw looks really interesting in that the core engine is ~4000 lines of code (fits into both my head and that of AI agents, so it feels manageable, auditable, flexible, etc.) and runs everything in containers by default. I also love their approach to configurability - it's not done via config files it's done via skills! For example, /add-telegram instructs your AI agent how to modify the actual code to integrate Telegram. I haven't come across this yet and it slightly blew my mind earlier today as a new, AI-enabled approach to preventing config mess and if-then-else monsters. Basically - the implied new meta is to write the most maximally forkable repo and then have skills that fork it into any desired more exotic configuration. Very cool.\n\nAnyway there are many others - e.g. nanobot, zeroclaw, ironclaw, picoclaw (lol @ prefixes). There are also cloud-hosted alternatives but tbh I don't love these because it feels much harder to tinker with. In particular, local setup allows easy connection to home automation gadgets on the local network. And I don't know, there is something aesthetically pleasing about there being a physical device 'possessed' by a little ghost of a personal digital house elf.\n\nNot 100% sure what my setup ends up looking like just yet but Claws are an awesome, exciting new layer of the AI stack.","category":"Strategy & Opinion","score":65,"addedAt":"2026-02-21T08:01:53.105Z","sourceType":"x-search","internalWeight":0.48,"fresh":true},{"id":3025,"title":"@unknown: AI Hype vs. Reality 🤖 Bridge the ROI gap with AI that drives operational value ...","url":"https://x.com/unknown/status/2024923615053897887","source":"X/@unknown","date":"Fri Feb 20 19:06:25 +0000 2026","summary":"AI Hype vs. Reality 🤖 Bridge the ROI gap with AI that drives operational value - from modeling to analysis.
