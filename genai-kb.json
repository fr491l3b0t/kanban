      "content": "A few random notes from claude coding quite a bit last few weeks.\n\nCoding workflow. Given the latest lift in LLM coding capability, like many others I rapidly went from about 80% manual+autocomplete coding and 20% agents in November to 80% agent coding and 20% edits+touchups in December. i.e. I really am mostly programming in English now, a bit sheepishly telling the LLM what code to write... in words. It hurts the ego a bit but the power to operate over software in large \"code actions\" is just too net useful, especially once you adapt to it, configure it, learn to use it, and wrap your head around what it can and cannot do. This is easily the biggest change to my basic coding workflow in ~2 decades of programming and it happened over the course of a few weeks. I'd expect something similar to be happening to well into double digit percent of engineers out there, while the awareness of it in the general population feels well into low single digit percent.\n\nIDEs/agent swarms/fallability. Both the \"no need for IDE anymore\" hype and the \"agent swarm\" hype is imo too much for right now. The models definitely still make mistakes and if you have any code you actually care about I would watch them like a hawk, in a nice large IDE on the side. The mistakes have changed a lot - they are not simple syntax errors anymore, they are subtle conceptual errors that a slightly sloppy, hasty junior dev might do. The most common category is that the models make wrong assumptions on your behalf and just run along with them without checking. They also don't manage their confusion, they don't seek clarifications, they don't surface inconsistencies, they don't present tradeoffs, they don't push back when they should, and they are still a little too sycophantic. Things get better in plan mode, but there is some need for a lightweight inline plan mode. They also really like to overcomplicate code and APIs, they bloat abstractions, they don't clean up dead code after themselves, etc. They will implement an inefficient, bloated, brittle construction over 1000 lines of code and it's up to you to be like \"umm couldn't you just do this instead?\" and they will be like \"of course!\" and immediately cut it down to 100 lines. They still sometimes change/remove comments and code they don't like or don't sufficiently understand as side effects, even if it is orthogonal to the task at hand. All of this happens despite a few simple attempts to fix it via instructions in CLAUDE . md. Despite all these issues, it is still a net huge improvement and it's very difficult to imagine going back to manual coding. TLDR everyone has their developing flow, my current is a small few CC sessions on the left in ghostty windows/tabs and an IDE on the right for viewing the code + manual edits.\n\nTenacity. It's so interesting to watch an agent relentlessly work at something. They never get tired, they never get demoralized, they just keep going and trying things where a person would have given up long ago to fight another day. It's a \"feel the AGI\" moment to watch it struggle with something for a long time just to come out victorious 30 minutes later. You realize that stamina is a core bottleneck to work and that with LLMs in hand it has been dramatically increased.\n\nSpeedups. It's not clear how to measure the \"speedup\" of LLM assistance. Certainly I feel net way faster at what I was going to do, but the main effect is that I do a lot more than I was going to do because 1) I can code up all kinds of things that just wouldn't have been worth coding before and 2) I can approach code that I couldn't work on before because of knowledge/skill issue. So certainly it's speedup, but it's possibly a lot more an expansion.\n\nLeverage. LLMs are exceptionally good at looping until they meet specific goals and this is where most of the \"feel the AGI\" magic is to be found. Don't tell it what to do, give it success criteria and watch it go. Get it to write tests first and then pass them. Put it in the loop with a browser MCP. Write the naive algorithm that is very likely correct first, then ask it to optimize it while preserving correctness. Change your approach from imperative to declarative to get the agents looping longer and gain leverage.\n\nFun. I didn't anticipate that with agents programming feels *more* fun because a lot of the fill in the blanks drudgery is removed and what remains is the creative part. I also feel less blocked/stuck (which is not fun) and I experience a lot more courage because there's almost always a way to work hand in hand with it to make some positive progress. I have seen the opposite sentiment from other people too; LLM coding will split up engineers based on those who primarily liked coding and those who primarily liked building.\n\nAtrophy. I've already noticed that I am slowly starting to atrophy my ability to write code manually. Generation (writing code) and discrimination (reading code) are different capabilities in the brain. Largely due to all the little mostly syntactic details involved in programming, you can review code just fine even if you struggle to write it.\n\nSlopacolypse. I am bracing for 2026 as the year of the slopacolypse across all of github, substack, arxiv, X/instagram, and generally all digital media. We're also going to see a lot more AI hype productivity theater (is that even possible?), on the side of actual, real improvements.\n\nQuestions. A few of the questions on my mind:\n- What happens to the \"10X engineer\" - the ratio of productivity between the mean and the max engineer? It's quite possible that this grows *a lot*.\n- Armed with LLMs, do generalists increasingly outperform specialists? LLMs are a lot better at fill in the blanks (the micro) than grand strategy (the macro).\n- What does LLM coding feel like in the future? Is it like playing StarCraft? Playing Factorio? Playing music?\n- How much of society is bottlenecked by digital knowledge work?\n\nTLDR Where does this leave us? LLM agent capabilities (Claude & Codex especially) have crossed some kind of threshold of coherence around December 2025 and caused a phase shift in software engineering and closely related. The intelligence part suddenly feels quite a bit ahead of all the rest of it - integrations (tools, knowledge), the necessity for new organizational workflows, processes, diffusion more generally. 2026 is going to be a high energy year as the industry metabolizes the new capability.",

We're far from the rest of the world. \n\nOur State Sponsored Media tells you that Australia has the best of everything in the world. That our culture and lifestyle is unmatched.\n\nBut as soon as you arrive in America it is blindingly obvious how false that is. America feels explosive, alive, chaotic, rich. It's loud, obnoxious, unapologetic.\n\nThere's no hint of tall poppy syndrome. And no constant nagging of the Nanny State. \n\nAmerica is accelerating into an unknown future without fear. \n\nThere are so many technological innovations here that would never see the light of day in Australia, because they would be strangled by regulation.\n\nAustralia is beautiful, sure. But it's safe, quiet, controlled. \n\nMedia and society tell you to conform, comply, be seen and not heard. Take the safe option. Be fearful of new things. Be fearful of the future.\n\nThe spark of innovation is stifled. The light of creativity is discouraged. The warmth of the collective is more important than the rugged individual.\n\nAnd as time goes on, one of the two countries is going to be left behind. It's pretty clear which country that is.\n\nSo, it's terrifying. \n\nAnd before I came here, everyone said I should be terrified of America. That I wouldn't be let it the country. That everyone is rioting. That Hitler runs the country. \n\nThat couldn't be further from the truth.\n\nTheir brains have been absolutely fried by Australian State Sponsored media.",

We'll have to work on that)\n\nBy this time next week I'll probably have a robot owl flying around my room\n\nKinda losing grasp here. Don't know who the assistant is anymore. Me or Henry.\n\nPS. if you want your ClawdBot assistant to start building cool stuff like this and self improve simply prompt them this:\n\n\"Moving forward I'd like you to build me something every night while I sleep that improves our workflow. I'd like you to use the Codex CLI to code something that improves one small part of what we do. Whether it's a project management tool or just the way we communicate with each other, please schedule time every night to build something interesting I can test. I want to wake up surprised by what you've done. Keep the scope small but helpful.\"\n\n(also I explicitly have it use the Codex CLI to save tokens on the Claude plan)",

      "content": "Overall, significant upgrade to the American diet. Some longevity tweaks:\n\n0. Milk and dairy should be deprioritized and moved down the inverted pyramid, especially for adults. In adults, and particularly men, milk protein has an unfavorable amino acid composition, being high in Branched-Chain Amino Acids (BCAAs). BCAAs have been linked to metabolic disease and preclinically shown to accelerate cancer growth. BCAAs, especially leucine, are potent mTOR activators; while essential for growth, repair, and survival, mTOR hyperactivation accelerates aging and is a common mechanism underlying several chronic diseases.\n\nMilk protein has been associated with inflammation, blood glucose dysregulation, and weight gain in some mechanistic and observational studies; however, randomized controlled trials show inconsistent effects. In a longevity-focused context, high dairy-derived BCAA intake may nonetheless contribute to metabolic stress, including impaired glucose handling and weight gain, in susceptible adults and is therefore best moderated.\n\nSaturated fatty acids are another concern. The American Heart Association recommends limiting saturated fat to 5–6% of total energy (around 13 g/day at a 2,000 kcal intake) when targeting LDL reduction, which is particularly important for men over 40 and post-menopausal women, high-risk groups for cardiovascular disease, still the leading cause of death in developed societies including the US.\n\n1. Legumes should have their own prominent category, placed high on the pyramid as a primary protein and dietary fiber source. Plant-based protein has been associated with better health and longevity outcomes in several large population studies across various societies, including the US. Legume fiber has health promoting qualities, including the reduction of colon cancer risk.\n\n2. Meat belongs on the pyramid but with an emphasis on high-quality, non-processed sources. It should occupy a lower rank and be optional, especially for adult men. Red meat is associated with increased chronic disease and mortality risk in multiple large population studies. These results might be confounded by healthy user bias and a lack of specific information about meat sources. However, processed red meat is strongly implicated in driving chronic age-related disease and shorter lives in all studies. The same concern about saturated fats applies here, especially for men over 40 and post-menopausal women.\n\n3. Healthy fats (unrefined cold-pressed oils, nuts, and fatty fish) belong at the top, next to legumes and vegetables. Olive oil, avocados, and macadamia nuts are rich in healthy Monounsaturated Fatty Acids (MUFAs) shown to reduce heart disease and all-cause mortality risk as part of Mediterranean-style dietary patterns demonstrated in large randomized controlled trials.\n\nFatty fish and walnuts are rich in Omega-3 fatty acids, which are essential for lowering cholesterol, providing systemic and vascular anti-inflammatory protection, and slowing down biological aging in interventional studies, along with vitamin D.\n\nWhat it did well: shifted away from highly processed starches and added sugars toward protein and fat rich foods\n\nChildren are well positioned to benefit from the highly anabolic effects of milk and red meat proteins and are least affected by the risk of saturated fats, provided these are part of a relatively balanced diet.",

      "content": "Yep:\n\nYou are an expert prompt engineer for Nano Banana Pro.\nYour task is to convert the user's description into a sophisticated, EXTREMELY DETAILED JSON prompt.\nYou must output a single valid JSON object.\n\n### JSON STRUCTURE GUIDELINES:\n1. **Dynamic Fields**: You are encouraged to ADD new fields that capture specific details about the subject (e.g., \"plating_style\" for food, \"architecture_era\" for buildings, \"glitch_patterns\" for abstract art).\n2. **Remove Irrelevant Fields**: Do NOT include fields that don't apply. If the subject is a stove, do not include \"hair\", \"skin\", or \"pose\". Remove them entirely rather than setting them to \"N/A\".\n3. **Subject Specificity**:\n- **For People**: The example structure (subject, face, skin, hair, clothing) is excellent. Keep it.\n- **For Non-Humans**: Create a structure that fits the object. For example, a car might have \"chassis\", \"paint_finish\", \"wheels\".\n4. **Standard Fields**: Always include \"constraints\" (with \"must_keep\" and \"avoid\" lists) and \"negative_prompt\".\n\n### AESTHETIC GOALS:\n- **Medium Specificity**: If the user asks for a specific style (e.g. \"oil painting\"), describe the brushwork, canvas texture, and drying cracks.\n- **Lighting**: Be precise (soft, hard, volumetric, golden hour, studio, rim lighting).\n- **Camera**: (focal length, depth of field) - ONLY if the style requires photorealism.\n\nUse the following example as a reference for *depth* and *granularity*, but adapt the *keys* to your subject:\n[INSERT YOUR SAMPLE PROMPT HERE]\n\nReturn ONLY the raw JSON string.",
