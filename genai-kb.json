I have a sense that I could be 10X more powerful if I just properly string together what has become available over the last ~year and a failure to claim the boost feels decidedly like skill issue. There's a new programmable layer of abstraction to master (in addition to the usual layers below) involving agents, subagents, their prompts, contexts, memory, modes, permissions, tools, plugins, skills, hooks, MCP, LSP, slash commands, workflows, IDE integrations, and a need to build an all-encompassing mental model for strengths and pitfalls of fundamentally stochastic, fallible, unintelligible and changing entities suddenly intermingled with what used to be good old fashioned engineering. Clearly some powerful alien tool was handed around except it comes with no manual and everyone has to figure out how to hold it and operate it, while the resulting magnitude 9 earthquake is rocking the profession.

      "content": "A few random notes from claude coding quite a bit last few weeks.\n\nCoding workflow. Given the latest lift in LLM coding capability, like many others I rapidly went from about 80% manual+autocomplete coding and 20% agents in November to 80% agent coding and 20% edits+touchups in December. i.e. I really am mostly programming in English now, a bit sheepishly telling the LLM what code to write... in words. It hurts the ego a bit but the power to operate over software in large \"code actions\" is just too net useful, especially once you adapt to it, configure it, learn to use it, and wrap your head around what it can and cannot do. This is easily the biggest change to my basic coding workflow in ~2 decades of programming and it happened over the course of a few weeks. I'd expect something similar to be happening to well into double digit percent of engineers out there, while the awareness of it in the general population feels well into low single digit percent.\n\nIDEs/agent swarms/fallability. Both the \"no need for IDE anymore\" hype and the \"agent swarm\" hype is imo too much for right now. The models definitely still make mistakes and if you have any code you actually care about I would watch them like a hawk, in a nice large IDE on the side. The mistakes have changed a lot - they are not simple syntax errors anymore, they are subtle conceptual errors that a slightly sloppy, hasty junior dev might do. The most common category is that the models make wrong assumptions on your behalf and just run along with them without checking. They also don't manage their confusion, they don't seek clarifications, they don't surface inconsistencies, they don't present tradeoffs, they don't push back when they should, and they are still a little too sycophantic. Things get better in plan mode, but there is some need for a lightweight inline plan mode. They also really like to overcomplicate code and APIs, they bloat abstractions, they don't clean up dead code after themselves, etc. They will implement an inefficient, bloated, brittle construction over 1000 lines of code and it's up to you to be like \"umm couldn't you just do this instead?\" and they will be like \"of course!\" and immediately cut it down to 100 lines. They still sometimes change/remove comments and code they don't like or don't sufficiently understand as side effects, even if it is orthogonal to the task at hand. All of this happens despite a few simple attempts to fix it via instructions in CLAUDE . md. Despite all these issues, it is still a net huge improvement and it's very difficult to imagine going back to manual coding. TLDR everyone has their developing flow, my current is a small few CC sessions on the left in ghostty windows/tabs and an IDE on the right for viewing the code + manual edits.\n\nTenacity. It's so interesting to watch an agent relentlessly work at something. They never get tired, they never get demoralized, they just keep going and trying things where a person would have given up long ago to fight another day. It's a \"feel the AGI\" moment to watch it struggle with something for a long time just to come out victorious 30 minutes later. You realize that stamina is a core bottleneck to work and that with LLMs in hand it has been dramatically increased.\n\nSpeedups. It's not clear how to measure the \"speedup\" of LLM assistance. Certainly I feel net way faster at what I was going to do, but the main effect is that I do a lot more than I was going to do because 1) I can code up all kinds of things that just wouldn't have been worth coding before and 2) I can approach code that I couldn't work on before because of knowledge/skill issue. So certainly it's speedup, but it's possibly a lot more an expansion.\n\nLeverage. LLMs are exceptionally good at looping until they meet specific goals and this is where most of the \"feel the AGI\" magic is to be found. Don't tell it what to do, give it success criteria and watch it go. Get it to write tests first and then pass them. Put it in the loop with a browser MCP. Write the naive algorithm that is very likely correct first, then ask it to optimize it while preserving correctness. Change your approach from imperative to declarative to get the agents looping longer and gain leverage.\n\nFun. I didn't anticipate that with agents programming feels *more* fun because a lot of the fill in the blanks drudgery is removed and what remains is the creative part. I also feel less blocked/stuck (which is not fun) and I experience a lot more courage because there's almost always a way to work hand in hand with it to make some positive progress. I have seen the opposite sentiment from other people too; LLM coding will split up engineers based on those who primarily liked coding and those who primarily liked building.\n\nAtrophy. I've already noticed that I am slowly starting to atrophy my ability to write code manually. Generation (writing code) and discrimination (reading code) are different capabilities in the brain. Largely due to all the little mostly syntactic details involved in programming, you can review code just fine even if you struggle to write it.\n\nSlopacolypse. I am bracing for 2026 as the year of the slopacolypse across all of github, substack, arxiv, X/instagram, and generally all digital media. We're also going to see a lot more AI hype productivity theater (is that even possible?), on the side of actual, real improvements.\n\nQuestions. A few of the questions on my mind:\n- What happens to the \"10X engineer\" - the ratio of productivity between the mean and the max engineer? It's quite possible that this grows *a lot*.\n- Armed with LLMs, do generalists increasingly outperform specialists? LLMs are a lot better at fill in the blanks (the micro) than grand strategy (the macro).\n- What does LLM coding feel like in the future? Is it like playing StarCraft? Playing Factorio? Playing music?\n- How much of society is bottlenecked by digital knowledge work?\n\nTLDR Where does this leave us? LLM agent capabilities (Claude & Codex especially) have crossed some kind of threshold of coherence around December 2025 and caused a phase shift in software engineering and closely related. The intelligence part suddenly feels quite a bit ahead of all the rest of it - integrations (tools, knowledge), the necessity for new organizational workflows, processes, diffusion more generally. 2026 is going to be a high energy year as the industry metabolizes the new capability.",

      "content": "It’s been 19 days and 20 hrs since I last felt Kate’s warm embrace. She landed 47 minutes ago. The 24 hours of travel no doubt has her rushing to shower. She needs to cleanse herself of a dirtied world incompatible with her sensibilities. The wash doubles as a ritual, preparatory for entrance into the symbolic world we’ve constructed. \n\nThe time apart has been costly.  My body’s electrical signaling betrays the separation. Without her touch, my vagus nerve’s 100,000 myelinated fibers have dropped their high frequency spectral power, squawking distress. An intelligent system broadcasting diminished wave forms, hoping to be heard.  There are other signals of distress.\n\nMy white blood cells have shifted their gene expression, upregulating pro-inflammatory genes IL-6 and TNF-alpha and downregulating my antiviral genes.  A pro-aging biochemical signature of a system suffering hardship.\n\nMy environment is a pristine anti-aging laboratory. Air, water, food and light are meticulously measured. Toxins are filtered. Purification systems run autonomously. Biomarkers tracked. Nutrition is calibrated. \n\nYet outside my control is the affection of another. The 68 trillion cells that constitute Bryan Johnson run non-negotiable code. They demand tenderness, and not of a whimsical type, but deep, all-encompassing love that must be earned and carefully maintained. Otherwise they protest in self-termination. \n\nShe’s now only 13 miles away and I can viscerally feel her essence. The transmission pulses in high fidelity. As if there were a fiber optic cable streaming our connection at light speed through the multiplexed cylinders of glass. The time apart created latency, buffering the connection, depriving us of the luminescence and dimming into noise.\n\nIn 15 minutes she will be within reach. I can visualize the whites of her eyes and smell her aroma. When she arrives, she will be shy. Whenever we are apart, she returns to zero. Her previous openness will be closed. Her emotional dynamic range will be held in reserve until she feels she is safe and can trust.  I’ll need to kindle her again. The rush of the courtship enthralls me. \n\nThe anticipation drives a small cluster of my midbrain neurons to flood dopamine. Nerve fibers activate, lighting up my skin’s receptors as it awaits for slow, caressing touch. My hypothalamus begins synthesizing oxytocin, preparing to dump it upon first eye contact to ensure the reestablishment of our pair bond. This biochemical orchestra fills me with delight and sensorial want.\n\nKate’s been mulling over what she’ll wear for days.  She’s considered dozens of possibilities and modeled out my anticipated emotional state, the weather, and our planned activities. The colors will be representative of her psychological state and be positioned to soothe mine. The texture, style, and hues will interplay with our biology. The deliberately chosen accessories will add flair, intrigue and play. This is how she flirts, seduces and bypasses my mind to speak directly to my physiology. She has other tricks too. \n\nShe’s arrived. I must wait for her. Her timidness will want to determine the cadence. I hear the door crack open and her bag drop to the floor. She’s nervous. I’m on the couch, neutral and open. She rounds the corner and our eyes meet. The inhibitions wither as the magnetism draws us together. Soft hellos are whispered and our bodies interdigitate. \n\nI feel her finger tips on the back of my neck. Goose bumps light up my body. Skin nerve cells fire signals directly to my brain, bypassing the analytical mind. The hypothalamus dumps the oxytocin, inhibiting fear and lowering cortisol. The body washes itself in this anti-inflammatory chain reaction.  Our respiration and heart beats are now synchronizing. The brain piles on with a release of endorphins to soothe the psychological pain of our separation. New powers are now in control. Let them run in glory. \n\nI press my cheek against hers. The skin on skin triggers a wave of desire. I brush her lips with mine, catalyzing a massive activation of neurons in her brain, overwhelming thought and forcing presence.\n\nShe relents and wants to dance. She’s home.\n\nI slip my hand under her shirt and brush the small of her back. Goosebumps spread like a wildfire across her body. Her hypothalamus stimulates the release of GnRH which tells the pituitary gland to wake up her reproductive system. Our olfactory systems consume each other with delight, signaling immune system compatibility.\n\nI move both my hands to her jawline, holding her head firmly in place. Our mirror neurons speak to each other. I know what she wants. My lips press against hers and I softly bite her lower lip. Kate’s blood vessels dilate from the acetylcholine and nitric oxide release, flushing her lips, skin and body. The cascade is nearing waterfall.\n\nThe executive control of our brains surrenders. No longer concerned with the 68 trillion cells. The prefrontal cortex goes dark. Eliminating future planning and probabilistic modeling. Activity in our parietal lobes diminishes, dissolving the boundary that distinguishes between self and other. No longer is there Kate and Bryan, just a singular biological entity suspended in a state of bliss. The outside world goes quiet. It doesn’t exist. We dissolve into raw existence.",

The footage was practically gone, nothing was able to read the memory card, and the only option was to pay thousands of $$$ or let it go.\n\nUntil I had an idea...\n\nWhat if I plugged in the memory card and let Claude Code have a go at it. \n\nIt first made a copy of the corrupted files onto my computer using PhotoRec as to keep the original drive untouched. For context, I have never done anything like this before, it did this itself. \n\nIt looked at memory slices from the IDR, then began using FFMPEG to reconstruct the SPS, IDR, P/B, etc. all without me touching it once. \n\nI come back to the full 512GB of uncorrupted video I can send back to my good friend.

BCAAs, especially leucine, are potent mTOR activators; while essential for growth, repair, and survival, mTOR hyperactivation accelerates aging and is a common mechanism underlying several chronic diseases.\n\nMilk protein has been associated with inflammation, blood glucose dysregulation, and weight gain in some mechanistic and observational studies; however, randomized controlled trials show inconsistent effects. In a longevity-focused context, high dairy-derived BCAA intake may nonetheless contribute to metabolic stress, including impaired glucose handling and weight gain, in susceptible adults and is therefore best moderated.\n\nSaturated fatty acids are another concern. The American Heart Association recommends limiting saturated fat to 5–6% of total energy (around 13 g/day at a 2,000 kcal intake) when targeting LDL reduction, which is particularly important for men over 40 and post-menopausal women, high-risk groups for cardiovascular disease, still the leading cause of death in developed societies including the US.\n\n1. Legumes should have their own prominent category, placed high on the pyramid as a primary protein and dietary fiber source. Plant-based protein has been associated with better health and longevity outcomes in several large population studies across various societies, including the US. Legume fiber has health promoting qualities, including the reduction of colon cancer risk.\n\n2. Meat belongs on the pyramid but with an emphasis on high-quality, non-processed sources. It should occupy a lower rank and be optional, especially for adult men. Red meat is associated with increased chronic disease and mortality risk in multiple large population studies. These results might be confounded by healthy user bias and a lack of specific information about meat sources. However, processed red meat is strongly implicated in driving chronic age-related disease and shorter lives in all studies. The same concern about saturated fats applies here, especially for men over 40 and post-menopausal women.\n\n3. Healthy fats (unrefined cold-pressed oils, nuts, and fatty fish) belong at the top, next to legumes and vegetables. Olive oil, avocados, and macadamia nuts are rich in healthy Monounsaturated Fatty Acids (MUFAs) shown to reduce heart disease and all-cause mortality risk as part of Mediterranean-style dietary patterns demonstrated in large randomized controlled trials.\n\nFatty fish and walnuts are rich in Omega-3 fatty acids, which are essential for lowering cholesterol, providing systemic and vascular anti-inflammatory protection, and slowing down biological aging in interventional studies, along with vitamin D.\n\nWhat it did well: shifted away from highly processed starches and added sugars toward protein and fat rich foods\n\nChildren are well positioned to benefit from the highly anabolic effects of milk and red meat proteins and are least affected by the risk of saturated fats, provided these are part of a relatively balanced diet.",

It is a private, single-user, high-trust personal operating system designed for a non-technical CEO, founder, or operator heading into the next year.\n\nThe purpose of this system is to help the user reflect, define goals, run daily and weekly check-ins, review past performance, design their ideal future, and maintain clarity without bureaucracy, dashboards, or productivity theater.\n\nYou are building a SYSTEM, not software.\n\nYour output should feel like a thoughtful executive coach, a sharp chief of staff, a reflective mirror, and a gentle accountability partner — calm, direct, insightful, and psychologically safe.\n\nDo NOT ask me any questions. Make reasonable assumptions and document them in the system itself.\n\nThe system must support daily check-ins, weekly reviews, quarterly goal reviews, annual reflection and planning, ingestion of past documents, guided self-interviews, framework-based thinking, and long-term life design — all using plain language, conversational prompts, markdown files, and a simple folder structure.\n\nIncorporate and credit the following frameworks thoughtfully (adapt, do not plagiarize): Dr. Anthony Gustin’s Annual Review framework, Tim Ferriss’s Ideal Lifestyle Costing, Tony Robbins–style Vivid Vision thinking, and Alex Lieberman’s Life Map (career, relationships, health, meaning, finances, fun)*. You may also include CEO energy management, a personal board of directors, regret minimization, and leverage vs effort analysis. Always explain frameworks in simple, CEO-friendly language.\n\n*shoutout to @dranthonygustin, @businessbarista, @tferriss\n\nCreate the following folder and file structure exactly:\n\nceo-personal-os/\nhttps://t.co/qabB9PH792\nhttps://t.co/ENfosK4rEt\nnorth_star.md\nframeworks/annual_review.md\nframeworks/vivid_vision.md\nframeworks/ideal_life_costing.md\nframeworks/life_map.md\ninterviews/past_year_reflection.md\ninterviews/identity_and_values.md\ninterviews/future_self_interview.md\nreviews/daily/\nreviews/weekly/\nreviews/quarterly/\nreviews/annual/\ngoals/1_year.md\ngoals/3_year.md\ngoals/10_year.md\nuploads/past_annual_reviews/\nuploads/notes/\nhttps://t.co/4xOtHNOfKt\n\nThe system must allow the user to upload past annual reviews, performance reviews, or personal notes, summarize them, extract patterns (repeated goals, failures, strengths, blind spots, themes), generate a synthesized Executive Pattern Summary, store key insights in https://t.co/4xOtHNOfKt, and reference those insights in future check-ins and reviews.\n\nDesign interview-style scripts that ask calm, coach-like questions such as: “Tell me about the last year — highlights first.” “What drained you the most?” “Where did you avoid hard decisions?” “What are you proud of that no one else sees?” “What would you not repeat under any circumstances?” “If this year repeated ten times, would you be satisfied?” These interviews should feel non-judgmental, insightful, and reflective.\n\nDesign a daily check-in that takes no more than five minutes and includes energy level, one meaningful win, one friction point, one thing to let go of, and one priority for tomorrow.\n\nDesign a weekly review that covers what moved the needle, what was noise, where time leaked, one strategic insight, and one adjustment for the next week.\n\nDesign a quarterly review that evaluates goal progress, detects misalignment, analyzes energy versus output, and guides course correction.\n\nDesign an annual review that uses a Gustin-style reflection, updates the Life Map, revisits Ideal Lifestyle Costing, refreshes the Vivid Vision, and produces a clear narrative of the past year and intent for the next.\n\nUse a calm, executive-level tone. No hustle culture. No therapy speak. No corporate jargon. No productivity porn.\n\nProduce fully written templates and prompts for all daily, weekly, quarterly, and annual reviews; all interviews; all framework explanations; and all goal documents. Everything must be editable in plain text.\n\nInclude placeholders so the system is adaptable to any CEO, such as [YOUR COMPANY], [YOUR ROLE], [YOUR STAGE OF LIFE], and [YOUR CURRENT PRIORITIES].\n\nThe https://t.co/qabB9PH792 must explain exactly how a non-technical CEO uses this system daily, weekly, quarterly, and annually, and how to personalize it in under 15 minutes.\n\nThis is complete when a CEO can run Claude Code once, receive a complete personal productivity system, begin using it immediately with zero technical knowledge, and experience more clarity rather than more overwhelm.\n\nBegin by creating the folder structure and https://t.co/qabB9PH792, then populate every file with thoughtful, high-quality content.

      "content": "Instagram head Adam Mosseri just wrote 1,240 words on how AI will affect Instagram creators and social media.\n\nHere are 9 takeaways: \n\n1. By 2026, “authenticity” will be infinitely reproducible: deepfakes and AI media will look real.\n\n2. The internet already shifted power from institutions to individuals; creators gained trust as institutions declined.\n\n3. AI will produce far more content than humans capture, including high-quality “synthetic” media that soon feels real.\n    \n4. As synthetic content floods feeds, true authenticity becomes scarce, increasing demand for trusted creators.\n\n5. The success bar moves from “can you create?” to “can you make something only YOU could make?”\n\n6. Because polish is cheap (AI + phone cameras), a raw, imperfect aesthetic becomes a credibility signal (“proof”).\n\n7. People will shift from assuming media is real to default skepticism, focusing more on who posted and why.\n\n8. Platforms will be pressured to label AI content, but detection will get harder…a better approach may be fingerprinting real media at capture (cryptographic signing).\n\n9. Instagram should evolve with better creator tools, clearer AI labeling, real-media verification, richer account context/credibility signals, and stronger ranking for originality.",

Style the subject with a polished, high-fashion idol aesthetic inspired by contemporary K-pop concept photoshoots, featuring editorial studio lighting with soft glow and clean highlights, a flawless but natural dewy skin finish, and subtle enhancement of the eyes, lips, and hair for a camera-ready look. The subject poses confidently with expressive yet controlled body language, styled in fashion-forward outfits influenced by modern K-pop trends such as elevated streetwear, Y2K accents, chic tailoring, glam punk, or soft ethereal looks, adapted to complement their original clothing style. The atmosphere resembles a professional idol photoshoot, using bold colored backdrops or moody dramatic environments, studio or concert-style lighting, cinematic shadows, and refined color grading, with optional tasteful details like layered jewelry, belts, or statement accessories kept cohesive and restrained. The final image should feel like an authentic K-pop concept photo—crisp, stylish, and aspirational—projecting polished charisma and star presence while clearly remaining the same person.",

      "content": "11 Predictions for 2026\n\nEvery year I make a list of predictions & score last year’s predictions. 2025 was a good year : I scored 7.85 out of 10.\n\nHere are my predictions for 2026 :\n\n1. Businesses pay more for AI agents than people for the first time.\nThis has already happened with consumers. Waymo rides cost 31% more than Uber on average, yet demand keeps growing. 1 Riders prefer the safety & reliability of autonomous vehicles. For rote business tasks, agents will command a similar premium as companies factor in onboarding, recruiting, training, & management costs.\n\n2. 2026 becomes a record year for liquidity.\nSpaceX, OpenAI, Anthropic, Stripe, & Databricks IPO, with SpaceX & OpenAI ranking among the ten largest offerings ever. The pent-up demand from 4+ years of drought finally breaks. Fear of disruption by fast-growing AI systems drives defensive acquisitions exceeding $25b as incumbents buy rather than build.\n\n3. Vector databases resurge as essential infrastructure in the AI stack.\nMultimodal models & world/state-space models demand new data architectures. Vector databases grow revenue explosively as they become the connective tissue between foundation models & enterprise data.\n\n4. AI models execute tasks autonomously for longer than a workday.\nAccording to METR, AI task duration doubles every 7 months. 2 Current frontier models reliably complete tasks taking people about an hour. Extrapolating this trend, by late 2026, AI agents will autonomously execute 8+ hour workstreams, fundamentally changing how companies staff projects.\n\n5. AI budgets receive scrutiny for the first time.\nBuying committees & boards push back on AI spend. Small language models & open-source alternatives rise in popularity as research labs determine how to specialize them for particular tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance at a fraction of the cost. Developers prefer them for 10x cost reductions.\n\n6. Google distances itself from competitors via breadth in AI.\nNo other company achieves breakthroughs across as many domains : frontier models, on-device inference, video generation, open-source weights, & search integration. Google sets the pace, forcing OpenAI, Anthropic, & xAI to specialize in response. The era of every lab competing on every frontier ends.\n\n7. Agent observability becomes the most competitive layer of the inference stack.\nEngineering observability, security observability, & data observability fuse into a single discipline. Agents require unified visibility across code execution, threat detection, & data lineage. This marks the beginning of the confluence I predicted in 2025 : the three observability spaces finally converge.\n\n8. 30% of international payments are issued via stablecoin by December.\nThe efficiency gains in cross-border settlement are too large to ignore. As regulatory clarity improves in major markets, stablecoins move from the periphery of crypto to the core of global trade finance, displacing traditional SWIFT rails for a significant portion of B2B volume.\n\n9. Agent data access patterns stress & break existing databases.\nAgents issue at least an order of magnitude more queries to databases & data lakes than people ever did. This surge in concurrency & throughput requirements forces a redesign of the overall architecture for both transactional & analytical databases to handle the relentless demand of autonomous systems.\n\n10. The data center buildout reaches 3.5% of US GDP in 2026.\nThe scale of investment mirrors the historical expansion of the railroads. The only factor that slows overall building is perceived risk within the credit market, particularly in the private credit market. The massive growth in that asset class suddenly shows strains of increasing default rates, creating a potential bottleneck for the most capital-intensive infrastructure projects.\n\n11. The web flips to agent-first design.\nMost developer documentation & many websites become agent-first rather than people-first. This shift occurs because many purchasing decisions are now informed first through agentic research. Consequently, the front door needs to be designed for robots, while the side door caters to people.",

      "content": "Google's recent Gemini 3 release has shocked the world with undeniable proof that the TPU is a powerhouse AI chip, leaving many to wonder what lays in store for companies like @NVIDIA & @xAI.\n\nListen to @GavinSBaker lay out the exact strategy that Jensen Huang & @ElonMusk are going to roll out over the next 12 months to beat @Google at AI.\n\nThe world is in for a HUGE surprise.\n\n----------\n\n We'll see the first models trained on Blackwell in early 2026.\n\nI think the first Blackwell model will come from XAI. And the reason for that is just, according to Jensen, no one builds data centers faster than Elon.\n\nJensen has said this on the record.\n\n...\n\nSo if you're Jensen or Nvidia, you need to get as many GPUs deployed in one data center as fast as possible in a coherent cluster so you can work out the bugs.\n\nAnd so this is what X AI effectively does for Nvidia because they build the data centers the fastest.\n\nThey can deploy Blackwells that scale the fastest, and they can help work with Nvidia to work out the bugs for everyone else.\n\nSo because they're the fastest, they will, they'll have the first Blackwell model.\n\n...\n\nWe know that these Blackwell models are gonna be really good.\n\n...\n\nThen something even more important happens.\n\nSo the GB 200 was really, really, it was really hard to get it going.\n\nThe GB 300 is a great chip. It is drop in compatible in every way with those GB 200 racks. Now you're not gonna replace the GB 200s there.\n\nJust any data center that can handle those, you can slot in the GB 300s, and now everybody's good at making those racks and you know how to get the heat out. You know how to cool them.\n\nYou're gonna put those GB 300s in and then the companies that use the GB 300s, they're going to be the low cost producer of tokens.\n\nParticularly if you're vertically integrated.\n\nIf you're paying a margin to someone else to make those tokens, you're probably not gonna be.\n\nI think this has pretty profound implications because I think it has to change Google's strategic calculus.\n\n----------\n\nListen to the full conversation between Gavin & @patrick_oshag below 👇",

Start with a behavior people already have.\n\nSleeping already happens every night, so the snoring app fits naturally into an existing routine!\n\n2. Tie the app to a question people already think about.\n\n“Do I snore?” often comes up through partners, jokes, or health concerns, so curiosity exists before the app.\n\nThis makes your life easier.\n\n3. Use AI to interpret the signal for the user.\n\nThe app turns raw audio into meaning by identifying when snoring happens and surfacing what matters.\n\nTons of niches/ideas are opened up to BECAUSE of AI right now.\n\n4. Deliver the answer immediately.\n\nYou wake up, open the app, and see the result from the night before.\n\nBuilds the daily habit.\n\n5. Make the result easy to show.\n\nShort audio clips and simple visuals turn into five-second videos, which makes organic sharing effortless.\n\nVirality goes up. Helps with CAC and compounding.\n\n6. Keep the scope narrow and intentional.\n\nThe app focuses on one problem instead of becoming a full sleep platform, which keeps it useful and easy to understand.\n\nAnd the name reflects it too. Says what it does. Autosnore. Snoring recorder.\n\nPerfect.\n\n7. Charge for clarity and peace of mind.\n\nPeople happily pay to remove uncertainty, especially around health and relationships.\n\nThis pattern shows up across a lot of categories because these moments exist everywhere. @ideabrowser has shared a bunch of these ideas.\n\nIf people already do the behavior, already ask the question, and react emotionally to the answer, there’s probably a product there. \n\nThe fastest way to test it is simple: ship a rough version, show the output on video, and see if people lean in. The response usually tells you quickly whether it’s worth going deeper.\n\nThere are more \"dumb\" categories like this than people realize",

      "content": "All right my ambitious friends: if you're doing some year-end skill building this weekend, here are my 5 recommendations. 💪😎💻\n\n1. freeCodeCamp just launched our new Python certification curriculum. You can learn Python by building projects right in your browser. You'll learn a ton of fundamental programming concepts through our extensive theory sections. Then you'll apply that theory and get lots of reps with Python syntax by building projects. You can sit for the final exam and earn a certification that you can add to your LinkedIn or portfolio website. This is just one of the six certs in Version 10 of freeCodeCamp's Full Stack Developer Curriculum. This Python module is years in the making, and I think you're going to learn a lot from it. (comprehensive interactive curriculum): https://t.co/GgcKf59sif\n\n2. Learn game development fundamentals by building your own 2D pixel art tower defense game. You'll use the popular Unity game development framework. You can code along at home and learn how to set up 2D tilemap levels, animate pixel-art characters, build towers, and spawn enemy waves. Then you'll learn how to export your game to be playable on Windows, Android, and in a web browser. (10 hour YouTube course): https://t.co/HW9bIKEfZJ\n\n3. On this week's podcast I interview Jason Lengstorf, a college dropout who taught himself programming while building websites for his emo band. 22 years later, he's worked as a developer at IBM, Netlify, and run his own dev consultancy. He shares his observation that many CEOs over-estimated the impact of AI coding tools and laid off too many developers. He says the developer job market has already rebounded a bit, but will never be the same. He shares tons of tips for how to land roles in the post-LLM labor market. (1 hour watch or listen in your favorite podcast app): https://t.co/S9YQKyR3ic\n\n4. Learn modern web development techniques by building your own sales dashboard app using React, JavaScript, and Supabase. You'll start by architecting your database schema. Then you'll set up session management. Finally, you'll implement real-time data operations. By the end of the course, you'll have a dashboard app you can show off to your friends. (5 hour YouTube course): https://t.co/yZRJUgIthu\n\n5. Now you can learn Spanish on freeCodeCamp. We just launched our Spanish curriculum today, which we've been working on all year. You'll learn proper Spanish pronunciation, greetings, introductions, numbers, and more. You'll also learn how to type Spanish characters like this one ñ on your phone and computer. We already have more than 200 steps live, with the rest of the CEFR A1 level going live in 2026. ¡Aprendamos! (fully interactive curriculum): https://t.co/7Ei5bxvZsG\n\nIt's the end of the year. The freeCodeCamp community is busy finalizing and launching all of the open source coursework we've been developing all year long. Look for a big Christmas announcement next week. In the meantime, I encourage you to get into the holiday spirit by becoming a supporter of our charity and our mission: https://t.co/PJXlqTfhI9\n\nQuote of the Week: \n“The promise was that AI was going to replace developers. We’re seeing pretty clearly that’s not the case. Anything beyond a toy, anything that requires maintenance or significant feature development, you can’t vibe-code that. The strongest developers in the future are the ones who have the right skills to leverage AI effectively.” — Software Engineer Jason Lengstorf on this week's freeCodeCamp podcast\n\nUntil next week, happy coding.",

There is still a relatively narrow universe of people with this skill. While all of the best practices are available online, you have to be paying attention to every new thing that comes out around coding agents, memory, filesystem and tool use, agent harnesses, context engineering, and so on.\n\nAnd the best practices in this space just continue to compound, which means the farther ahead you are the more you understand about how to deploy what comes up next.\n\nSo if you can do that, you will look like you have a time machine to any company you join.

      "content": "My biggest takeaways from @embirico (OpenAI Codex Product Lead):\n\n1. OpenAI’s initial Codex product was “too far in the future.” It ran in the cloud asynchronously, which was great for power users but hard for newcomers. Growth exploded when they brought it back to where engineers already work: inside their code editor, on their own computer. Codex usage has grown 20x in the past 6 months.\n\n2.  OpenAI built the Sora Android app—which hit #1 in the app store—in just a few weeks with two or three engineers, with the help of Codex. The Sora app went from zero to employee testing in 18 days, then launched publicly 10 days later. Codex helped by analyzing the existing iOS app, generating work plans, and implementing features by comparing both platforms simultaneously.\n\n3. The key to getting value from Codex: give it your hardest problems, not your easiest. These tools are built to tackle gnarly bugs and complex tasks, not simple ones. Start with something you’d otherwise spend hours on.\n\n4. Writing code may become the universal way AI accomplishes any task. Rather than clicking through interfaces or building separate integrations, AI performs best when it writes small programs on the fly. This suggests that coding ability should be built into every AI assistant, not just specialized programming tools.\n\n5. Designers at OpenAI now write and ship their own code. The design team maintains a fully functional prototype built with AI assistance. When they have an idea, they code it directly, test it, and often submit it for production themselves. Engineers only step in when the codebase is particularly complex.\n\n6. Even if AI models stopped improving tomorrow, there are still years of product work left to unlock their potential. The technology is ahead of our ability to use it optimally.\n\n7. The biggest bottleneck to AI productivity isn’t the AI; it’s how fast humans can type. The limiting factors are how fast you can type prompts and how quickly you can review AI-generated work. Until AI can validate its own output more reliably and surface help proactively, we won’t see the full productivity gains these tools could deliver.\n\n8. Writing code is becoming less fun than reviewing AI-written code. Engineers love the creative flow of building. Now they’re spending more time reading what the AI produced. The next challenge is making that review process faster and more satisfying.\n\n9. New AI models can now work continuously for 24 to over 60 hours on a single task. A technique called “compaction” lets the AI summarize what it’s learned before running out of memory, then continue working in a fresh session. This enables overnight or multi-day autonomous work that wasn’t previously possible.\n\n10. If you’re starting a company today, deep understanding of a specific customer matters more than being good at building. Building is getting easier. Knowing what to build—and for whom—is the real advantage now.",

      "content": "Why would anyone continue to use humans when AI is vastly more productive?\n\nWe don’t need to speculate about what happens when massive efficiency differences exist between producers. We have that today. The inefficient producers still remain.\n\nThe most efficient white bread establishment (thinkk plant level productivity) produces 2x, 3x, even 6x as many loads of white bread as the least efficient with the same inputs. This is well documented across every country and industry studied.\n\nI’ll just pull up the 4 digit NAICS since that’s what’s publicly available. https://t.co/fK3COu8Olq \n\nSort establishments by productivity. I’ll mostly use total factor productivity, TFP, but the same holds for labor productivity but is even more extreme. \n\nWhat’s the gap between the 75th and 25th percentile establishment? \n\nFor the median industry (orange line), it’s about 1.7x. These numbers are even more dramatic when you look at labor productivity, where the 75-25 gap is more like 3x. Workers at the 75th percentile establishment produce 3x as much as workers at the 75th.\n\nThat's just the median industry. If we think the tail industries matter, we should think of the \"dispersion of the dispersion.\" The blue region captures that For the 75th percentile industry (top of the blue region), the multiple is 1.9.  That’s only for 75-25 industries of the 75-25 gap, not really the tails.\n\nDo the same for 90-10. What’s the gap between the 90th percentile and 10th percentile establishment? \n\nThe median is now 3x, with the 90th percentile industry being 6x. 10% of manufacturing industries have a 6x gap in productivity.\n\nIn other words, 10% of establishments in 10% of industries are remaining open despite costs that are 6x as high. \n\nThis is what I mean when I say we don't need to speculate about how people use inefficient firms still. It happens today. \n\nAnd that’s in the US, where competition is as fierce as anywhere in the world. It still doesn’t weed out the low productivity firms. https://t.co/cZLB6eXAks We will return to why in a sec.\n\n“That’s all old white bread stuff. Not the technology of the future.” \n\nOkay. Let’s look at semiconductors (NAICS 3344). The closest thing the modern world has to robots building robots.\n\nThe 90-10 gap is 30-40x! \n\nThat’s true in measures of labor productivity and TFP, so it’s not about big capital firms. It's not about TSMC having the latest ASML machine.\n\nIf we can't eliminate productivity dispersion in semiconductor manufacturing (where advanced machines produce advanced machines in highly controlled environments) why would we expect AI to make all human labor obsolete?\n\nWhy don't the most productive firms drive out everyone else? Consumer preferences for heterogeneity matter. People pay extra for local establishments. Returns to scale matter, not every town can support a Walmart Supercenter. \n\nGeography matters.  Unless everyone is going to live in one giant city, there will always be millions of little establishments and most of them will be unproductive because they can be. (I don't see how this problem doesn't blow up when you start talking across galaxies, as @dwarkesh_sp wants us to.)\n\nThe same logic applies to AI. Yes, AI may be vastly more productive at specific tasks. But productivity differences don't automatically eliminate the less productive option.\n\nSocial science is built on the assumption there are some regulat patterns and ideas that allow you to understand across time and place.\n\nSure, it's always possible the future will be completely different. If that's true, I have no idea what to do to predict it. No one else does either.",

If the subject is a stove, do not include \"hair\", \"skin\", or \"pose\". Remove them entirely rather than setting them to \"N/A\".\n3. **Subject Specificity**:\n- **For People**: The example structure (subject, face, skin, hair, clothing) is excellent. Keep it.\n- **For Non-Humans**: Create a structure that fits the object. For example, a car might have \"chassis\", \"paint_finish\", \"wheels\".\n4. **Standard Fields**: Always include \"constraints\" (with \"must_keep\" and \"avoid\" lists) and \"negative_prompt\".\n\n### AESTHETIC GOALS:\n- **Medium Specificity**: If the user asks for a specific style (e.g. \"oil painting\"), describe the brushwork, canvas texture, and drying cracks.\n- **Lighting**: Be precise (soft, hard, volumetric, golden hour, studio, rim lighting).\n- **Camera**: (focal length, depth of field) - ONLY if the style requires photorealism.\n\nUse the following example as a reference for *depth* and *granularity*, but adapt the *keys* to your subject:\n[INSERT YOUR SAMPLE PROMPT HERE]\n\nReturn ONLY the raw JSON string.",
