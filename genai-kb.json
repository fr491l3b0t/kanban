Given the latest lift in LLM coding capability, like many others I rapidly went from about 80% manual+autocomplete coding and 20% agents in November to 80% agent coding and 20% edits+touchups in December. i.e. I really am mostly programming in English now, a bit sheepishly telling the LLM what code to write... in words. It hurts the ego a bit but the power to operate over software in large \"code actions\" is just too net useful, especially once you adapt to it, configure it, learn to use it, and wrap your head around what it can and cannot do. This is easily the biggest change to my basic coding workflow in ~2 decades of programming and it happened over the course of a few weeks. I'd expect something similar to be happening to well into double digit percent of engineers out there, while the awareness of it in the general population feels well into low single digit percent.\n\nIDEs/agent swarms/fallability. Both the \"no need for IDE anymore\" hype and the \"agent swarm\" hype is imo too much for right now. The models definitely still make mistakes and if you have any code you actually care about I would watch them like a hawk, in a nice large IDE on the side. The mistakes have changed a lot - they are not simple syntax errors anymore, they are subtle conceptual errors that a slightly sloppy, hasty junior dev might do. The most common category is that the models make wrong assumptions on your behalf and just run along with them without checking. They also don't manage their confusion, they don't seek clarifications, they don't surface inconsistencies, they don't present tradeoffs, they don't push back when they should, and they are still a little too sycophantic. Things get better in plan mode, but there is some need for a lightweight inline plan mode. They also really like to overcomplicate code and APIs, they bloat abstractions, they don't clean up dead code after themselves, etc. They will implement an inefficient, bloated, brittle construction over 1000 lines of code and it's up to you to be like \"umm couldn't you just do this instead?\" and they will be like \"of course!\" and immediately cut it down to 100 lines. They still sometimes change/remove comments and code they don't like or don't sufficiently understand as side effects, even if it is orthogonal to the task at hand. All of this happens despite a few simple attempts to fix it via instructions in CLAUDE . md. Despite all these issues, it is still a net huge improvement and it's very difficult to imagine going back to manual coding. TLDR everyone has their developing flow, my current is a small few CC sessions on the left in ghostty windows/tabs and an IDE on the right for viewing the code + manual edits.\n\nTenacity. It's so interesting to watch an agent relentlessly work at something. They never get tired, they never get demoralized, they just keep going and trying things where a person would have given up long ago to fight another day. It's a \"feel the AGI\" moment to watch it struggle with something for a long time just to come out victorious 30 minutes later. You realize that stamina is a core bottleneck to work and that with LLMs in hand it has been dramatically increased.\n\nSpeedups. It's not clear how to measure the \"speedup\" of LLM assistance. Certainly I feel net way faster at what I was going to do, but the main effect is that I do a lot more than I was going to do because 1) I can code up all kinds of things that just wouldn't have been worth coding before and 2) I can approach code that I couldn't work on before because of knowledge/skill issue. So certainly it's speedup, but it's possibly a lot more an expansion.\n\nLeverage. LLMs are exceptionally good at looping until they meet specific goals and this is where most of the \"feel the AGI\" magic is to be found. Don't tell it what to do, give it success criteria and watch it go. Get it to write tests first and then pass them. Put it in the loop with a browser MCP. Write the naive algorithm that is very likely correct first, then ask it to optimize it while preserving correctness. Change your approach from imperative to declarative to get the agents looping longer and gain leverage.\n\nFun. I didn't anticipate that with agents programming feels *more* fun because a lot of the fill in the blanks drudgery is removed and what remains is the creative part. I also feel less blocked/stuck (which is not fun) and I experience a lot more courage because there's almost always a way to work hand in hand with it to make some positive progress. I have seen the opposite sentiment from other people too; LLM coding will split up engineers based on those who primarily liked coding and those who primarily liked building.\n\nAtrophy. I've already noticed that I am slowly starting to atrophy my ability to write code manually. Generation (writing code) and discrimination (reading code) are different capabilities in the brain. Largely due to all the little mostly syntactic details involved in programming, you can review code just fine even if you struggle to write it.\n\nSlopacolypse. I am bracing for 2026 as the year of the slopacolypse across all of github, substack, arxiv, X/instagram, and generally all digital media. We're also going to see a lot more AI hype productivity theater (is that even possible?), on the side of actual, real improvements.\n\nQuestions. A few of the questions on my mind:\n- What happens to the \"10X engineer\" - the ratio of productivity between the mean and the max engineer? It's quite possible that this grows *a lot*.\n- Armed with LLMs, do generalists increasingly outperform specialists? LLMs are a lot better at fill in the blanks (the micro) than grand strategy (the macro).\n- What does LLM coding feel like in the future? Is it like playing StarCraft? Playing Factorio? Playing music?\n- How much of society is bottlenecked by digital knowledge work?\n\nTLDR Where does this leave us? LLM agent capabilities (Claude & Codex especially) have crossed some kind of threshold of coherence around December 2025 and caused a phase shift in software engineering and closely related. The intelligence part suddenly feels quite a bit ahead of all the rest of it - integrations (tools, knowledge), the necessity for new organizational workflows, processes, diffusion more generally. 2026 is going to be a high energy year as the industry metabolizes the new capability.","tags":["claude","agents","workflow","codex"],"engagement":44338,"dataSource":"bookmark","sourceType":"x-bookmark","internalWeight":0.78,"fresh":true},{"id":7,"title":"Travelling to America as an Australian is terrifying.","category":"Australia","source":"@johngoddard","date":"2026-01-18","url":"https://x.com/johngoddard/status/2012973408263320045","summary":"Travelling to America as an Australian is terrifying.

It's pretty clear which country that is.\n\nSo, it's terrifying. \n\nAnd before I came here, everyone said I should be terrified of America. That I wouldn't be let it the country.

Milk and dairy should be deprioritized and moved down the inverted pyramid, especially for adults. In adults, and particularly men, milk protein has an unfavorable amino acid composition, being high in Branched-Chain Amino Acids (BCAAs). BCAAs have been linked to metabolic disease and preclinically shown to accelerate cancer growth. BCAAs, especially leucine, are potent mTOR activators; while essential for growth, repair, and survival, mTOR hyperactivation accelerates aging and is a common mechanism underlying several chronic diseases.\n\nMilk protein has been associated with inflammation, blood glucose dysregulation, and weight gain in some mechanistic and observational studies; however, randomized controlled trials show inconsistent effects. In a longevity-focused context, high dairy-derived BCAA intake may nonetheless contribute to metabolic stress, including impaired glucose handling and weight gain, in susceptible adults and is therefore best moderated.\n\nSaturated fatty acids are another concern. The American Heart Association recommends limiting saturated fat to 5–6% of total energy (around 13 g/day at a 2,000 kcal intake) when targeting LDL reduction, which is particularly important for men over 40 and post-menopausal women, high-risk groups for cardiovascular disease, still the leading cause of death in developed societies including the US.\n\n1. Legumes should have their own prominent category, placed high on the pyramid as a primary protein and dietary fiber source. Plant-based protein has been associated with better health and longevity outcomes in several large population studies across various societies, including the US. Legume fiber has health promoting qualities, including the reduction of colon cancer risk.\n\n2. Meat belongs on the pyramid but with an emphasis on high-quality, non-processed sources. It should occupy a lower rank and be optional, especially for adult men. Red meat is associated with increased chronic disease and mortality risk in multiple large population studies. These results might be confounded by healthy user bias and a lack of specific information about meat sources. However, processed red meat is strongly implicated in driving chronic age-related disease and shorter lives in all studies. The same concern about saturated fats applies here, especially for men over 40 and post-menopausal women.\n\n3. Healthy fats (unrefined cold-pressed oils, nuts, and fatty fish) belong at the top, next to legumes and vegetables. Olive oil, avocados, and macadamia nuts are rich in healthy Monounsaturated Fatty Acids (MUFAs) shown to reduce heart disease and all-cause mortality risk as part of Mediterranean-style dietary patterns demonstrated in large randomized controlled trials.\n\nFatty fish and walnuts are rich in Omega-3 fatty acids, which are essential for lowering cholesterol, providing systemic and vascular anti-inflammatory protection, and slowing down biological aging in interventional studies, along with vitamin D.\n\nWhat it did well: shifted away from highly processed starches and added sugars toward protein and fat rich foods\n\nChildren are well positioned to benefit from the highly anabolic effects of milk and red meat proteins and are least affected by the risk of saturated fats, provided these are part of a relatively balanced diet.","tags":[],"engagement":6010,"dataSource":"bookmark","sourceType":"x-bookmark","internalWeight":0.78,"fresh":true},{"id":27,"title":"If you’ve never written code before, this is for you.

I’ve just launched a course that shows you, in less than 30 minutes, how to describe an idea for an app and build it with AI.\n\nIn this course, you'll build a working web application - a funny interactive birthday message generator that runs in your browser and can be shared with friends. You'll customize it by telling AI how you want it changed, and tweak it until it works the way you want. By the end, you'll have a repeatable process you can apply to build a wide variety of applications.\n\nIf you want to try vibe coding, this will be the best place to start! Further, you'll be able to use these techniques with whatever tool you're most comfortable with (like ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, or others) -- we're vendor neutral. \n\nSkills you'll gain:\n- How to build web apps with AI - zero coding skills needed\n- How to fix and improve your creations by chatting with AI\n- A simple process you can use to build other things you can dream up\n\nBuilding with AI is one of the most fun things in the world. Please join me and take your first step! I think you will be surprised at what you can build. And if you're an experienced engineer, please share this with someone in your life who's been curious about building with AI.\n\nCome build with me! https://t.co/q6gyzlxWFS","tags":["claude","gpt","gemini"],"engagement":5990,"dataSource":"bookmark","sourceType":"x-bookmark","internalWeight":0.78,"fresh":true},{"id":28,"title":"I learned and used the Claude Agent SDK today to build an agent.

Your planning space.\n\n🔶 Cowork → Claude Code for absolute non-technicals. Get work done end-to-end on your local files with parallel agents. It's designed for simplicity, not advanced customization.\n\n🔶 Claude Code (desktop) → where you build custom project-scoped skills and agents, plugins, complex integrations. The building experience I've found is the best here, and it's actually very non-technical friendly.\n\nSo the biggest unlock is not using Cowork alone, but knowing when to use it, where it makes sense, and how they fit together as a system.\n\nHere are some you can start with for your marketing workflow:\n\n1/ Claude Project + Cowork for Repeatable Workflows\n→ Add your existing Claude Project to Cowork, point it to a local folder with raw materials, and it generates deliverables end to end following your exact workflow instructions.\n\n2/ Marketing Creative Pipeline\n→ Spin up parallel agents in one go in your local folder. One generates ad variations, another writes product descriptions, and it updates your master spreadsheet when done.\n\n3/ Data Analysis & Reporting\n→ Point Cowork to a repository with your datasets, let it analyze everything and turn insights into dashboards, strategy decks, and recommendations in one go.\n\n4/ Browser-Based Task Automation\n→ Claude in Chrome + Cowork let you delegate browser tasks that would take hours manually. Track AI search results, capture cited sources, generate reports… anything you'd normally do in a browser but hard to automate.\n\n5/ Custom Skills with Claude Code\n→ Build a custom skill once in Claude Code (e.g. a landing page audit), install it in Cowork, and trigger it anytime, anywhere.\n\nBonus:\nTake this further with your custom Plugins if you need to share the entire setup with team instead of piece by piece. Bundling skills, slash commands or MCP connections into one package. But you really need this only when you need distribution and standardization.\n\n#Claude #ClaudeCowork","category":"AI Coding & Agents","score":90,"addedAt":"2026-02-09T19:02:46.814Z","sourceType":"x-search","internalWeight":0.48,"fresh":true},{"id":546,"title":"@unknown: AI just leveled up in 2026!

It connects to your CRM, your data warehouse, your ticketing tools, your internal apps, then lets AI agents execute workflows across all of them. Salesforce charges per seat. Workday charges per seat. ServiceNow charges per seat. If an AI agent can run a sales workflow without a human ever logging into Salesforce, the entire economic logic of \"per-seat licensing\" collapses.\n\nSalesforce knows this. They've been sprinting to build Agentforce and hit $1.4B in ARR across their agentic products, processing 3.2 trillion tokens, signing 18,500 deals. They're trying to be the agent platform before someone else makes them the agent's tool.\n\nNow OpenAI is saying: we'll be the layer that sits above all of your enterprise software. We'll give agents identity, permissions, and access to every system. And we'll let third-party agents from Google, Anthropic, and anyone else run on it too.\n\nThat last part is the move. By going model-agnostic and vendor-agnostic on agents, OpenAI is positioning Frontier as the operating system of the enterprise. The SaaS vendors become the apps.\n\nFidji Simo said it herself. When she was CEO of Instacart, her team spent months integrating each AI tool, and they still ended up with silos. Every enterprise CTO has lived this exact pain.\n\nThe companies signing up tell the story. Intuit, Uber, State Farm, Thermo Fisher. These aren't AI experiments. These are Fortune 500 operations teams saying \"we need one platform to manage all our agents.\"\n\nOpenAI lost $5B+ last year. This is how they plan to make it back. Consumption-based enterprise contracts where agents run on your infrastructure, processing your data, 24/7. The revenue per customer isn't a seat license. It's metered compute on mission-critical workflows.\n\nIf Frontier works, every SaaS company becomes a feature inside OpenAI's platform. If it doesn't, OpenAI just handed Salesforce and Anthropic the playbook for what enterprises actually want.\n\nEither way, \"per-seat\" is dying. The only question is who collects the compute bill.","category":"Industry & Business","score":70,"addedAt":"2026-02-09T19:02:46.814Z","sourceType":"x-search","internalWeight":0.48,"fresh":true},{"id":558,"title":"@unknown: $285 BILLION.\nGone.

Given the latest lift in LLM coding capability, like many others I rapidly went from about 80% manual+autocomplete coding and 20% agents in November to 80% agent coding and 20% edits+touchups in December. i.e. I really am mostly programming in English now, a bit sheepishly telling the LLM what code to write... in words. It hurts the ego a bit but the power to operate over software in large \"code actions\" is just too net useful, especially once you adapt to it, configure it, learn to use it, and wrap your head around what it can and cannot do. This is easily the biggest change to my basic coding workflow in ~2 decades of programming and it happened over the course of a few weeks. I'd expect something similar to be happening to well into double digit percent of engineers out there, while the awareness of it in the general population feels well into low single digit percent.\n\nIDEs/agent swarms/fallability. Both the \"no need for IDE anymore\" hype and the \"agent swarm\" hype is imo too much for right now. The models definitely still make mistakes and if you have any code you actually care about I would watch them like a hawk, in a nice large IDE on the side. The mistakes have changed a lot - they are not simple syntax errors anymore, they are subtle conceptual errors that a slightly sloppy, hasty junior dev might do. The most common category is that the models make wrong assumptions on your behalf and just run along with them without checking. They also don't manage their confusion, they don't seek clarifications, they don't surface inconsistencies, they don't present tradeoffs, they don't push back when they should, and they are still a little too sycophantic. Things get better in plan mode, but there is some need for a lightweight inline plan mode. They also really like to overcomplicate code and APIs, they bloat abstractions, they don't clean up dead code after themselves, etc. They will implement an inefficient, bloated, brittle construction over 1000 lines of code and it's up to you to be like \"umm couldn't you just do this instead?\" and they will be like \"of course!\" and immediately cut it down to 100 lines. They still sometimes change/remove comments and code they don't like or don't sufficiently understand as side effects, even if it is orthogonal to the task at hand. All of this happens despite a few simple attempts to fix it via instructions in CLAUDE . md. Despite all these issues, it is still a net huge improvement and it's very difficult to imagine going back to manual coding. TLDR everyone has their developing flow, my current is a small few CC sessions on the left in ghostty windows/tabs and an IDE on the right for viewing the code + manual edits.\n\nTenacity. It's so interesting to watch an agent relentlessly work at something. They never get tired, they never get demoralized, they just keep going and trying things where a person would have given up long ago to fight another day. It's a \"feel the AGI\" moment to watch it struggle with something for a long time just to come out victorious 30 minutes later. You realize that stamina is a core bottleneck to work and that with LLMs in hand it has been dramatically increased.\n\nSpeedups. It's not clear how to measure the \"speedup\" of LLM assistance. Certainly I feel net way faster at what I was going to do, but the main effect is that I do a lot more than I was going to do because 1) I can code up all kinds of things that just wouldn't have been worth coding before and 2) I can approach code that I couldn't work on before because of knowledge/skill issue. So certainly it's speedup, but it's possibly a lot more an expansion.\n\nLeverage. LLMs are exceptionally good at looping until they meet specific goals and this is where most of the \"feel the AGI\" magic is to be found. Don't tell it what to do, give it success criteria and watch it go. Get it to write tests first and then pass them. Put it in the loop with a browser MCP. Write the naive algorithm that is very likely correct first, then ask it to optimize it while preserving correctness. Change your approach from imperative to declarative to get the agents looping longer and gain leverage.\n\nFun. I didn't anticipate that with agents programming feels *more* fun because a lot of the fill in the blanks drudgery is removed and what remains is the creative part. I also feel less blocked/stuck (which is not fun) and I experience a lot more courage because there's almost always a way to work hand in hand with it to make some positive progress. I have seen the opposite sentiment from other people too; LLM coding will split up engineers based on those who primarily liked coding and those who primarily liked building.\n\nAtrophy. I've already noticed that I am slowly starting to atrophy my ability to write code manually. Generation (writing code) and discrimination (reading code) are different capabilities in the brain. Largely due to all the little mostly syntactic details involved in programming, you can review code just fine even if you struggle to write it.\n\nSlopacolypse. I am bracing for 2026 as the year of the slopacolypse across all of github, substack, arxiv, X/instagram, and generally all digital media. We're also going to see a lot more AI hype productivity theater (is that even possible?), on the side of actual, real improvements.\n\nQuestions. A few of the questions on my mind:\n- What happens to the \"10X engineer\" - the ratio of productivity between the mean and the max engineer? It's quite possible that this grows *a lot*.\n- Armed with LLMs, do generalists increasingly outperform specialists? LLMs are a lot better at fill in the blanks (the micro) than grand strategy (the macro).\n- What does LLM coding feel like in the future? Is it like playing StarCraft? Playing Factorio? Playing music?\n- How much of society is bottlenecked by digital knowledge work?\n\nTLDR Where does this leave us? LLM agent capabilities (Claude & Codex especially) have crossed some kind of threshold of coherence around December 2025 and caused a phase shift in software engineering and closely related. The intelligence part suddenly feels quite a bit ahead of all the rest of it - integrations (tools, knowledge), the necessity for new organizational workflows, processes, diffusion more generally. 2026 is going to be a high energy year as the industry metabolizes the new capability.","category":"AI Coding & Agents","score":65,"addedAt":"2026-02-09T19:02:46.815Z","sourceType":"x-search","internalWeight":0.48,"fresh":true},{"id":570,"title":"@unknown: 用着Claude Code, 看着 #Claude 的Token哗哗地流；\n\n想着Anthropic的服务器嗡嗡叫，收到的钱滴滴响，母公司和英伟达的股票蹭蹭涨。...","url":"https://x.com/unknown/status/2020936081009787148","source":"X/@unknown","date":"Mon Feb 09 19:01:23 +0000 2026","summary":"用着Claude Code, 看着 #Claude 的Token哗哗地流；\n\n想着Anthropic的服务器嗡嗡叫，收到的钱滴滴响，母公司和英伟达的股票蹭蹭涨。\n\n这，就是AI，让人停不下来。\n\n所有人，谁也跑不掉。 https://t.co/Cuu4o2mrJP","category":"AI Coding & Agents","score":65,"addedAt":"2026-02-09T19:02:46.815Z","sourceType":"x-search","internalWeight":0.48,"fresh":true},{"id":571,"title":"@unknown: 🥷 Aurora Alpha vient de drop sur OpenRouter\n\nUn modèle de raisonnement ultra-ra...","url":"https://x.com/unknown/status/2020935953829986741","source":"X/@unknown","date":"Mon Feb 09 19:00:53 +0000 2026","summary":"🥷 Aurora Alpha vient de drop sur OpenRouter\n\nUn modèle de raisonnement ultra-rapide, optimisé pour le coding.\n\nPendant ce temps, Seedance 2.0 génère des vidéos cinématiques d'1 minute en 5 min.\n\nEt Anthropic confirme que Claude écrit maintenant des PR de 2000-3000 lignes... tout seul.\n\n2026 commence fort 🔥","category":"AI Tools & Platforms","score":65,"addedAt":"2026-02-09T19:02:46.815Z","sourceType":"x-search","internalWeight":0.48,"fresh":true},{"id":572,"title":"@unknown: Anthropic papers: “Why do our models smell, well, smell like poop?

(Though one of the primary motivations for me writing nanochat is that I'd very much love for it to be used this way as a benchmark for agents, and I'd love it if it worked over time). I'm open to this just being skill issue.\n\nE.g. here some of the things I'd be suspicious about:\n- the zoo of torch compile flags can knowingly be abused to get +1% gains but often at the cost of +30min compile time. This is why modded-nanogpt prohibits torch compile kwarg engineering and why I haven't done any in nanochat either. i wouldn't reliably expect the model to notice, consider, or flag this kind of an issue or seek clarification.\n- ns_steps=3 might be a tiny bit of speed, but does the model also volunteer to make sure quality doesn't fall too much?\n- same thing for deleting .float() cast - sure you can remove it and get VRAM/speed gains but it's there for a clear reason (extra precision in the loss function). Removing it means you absolutely have to make sure that the lower precision is ok validation loss wise, in a highly controlled experiment.\n\nOverall I'm still struggling with getting the models to do significantly more basic things. For example, Opus keeps incorrectly \"cleaning up\" my comments when it doesn't understand them even when it's completely unrelated to the task, rude! It keeps violating and ignoring CLAUDE .md instructions on coding style but when I ask, it correctly points out all the violations. I know, I'm supposed to be using some kind of a /cleanup. Yesterday it gave me a table of results and incorrectly reported which experiment worked best (the table showed xyz=20 was best and it incorrectly claimed that xyz=12 was). Basically - much simpler things still fail routinely than something open-ended like \"improve nanochat\". (I've been doing a lot of YELLING IN UPPER CASE and I think this could actually be a really good metric for A/B testing instead of the inline survey thing.). Still incredibly net useful with oversight and with clear, well-scoped tasks.\n\nI definitely haven't given up on automatic closed-loop experiments with the models. It would be so glorious. I had 2 iterations that basically didn't work but I have ideas for the 3rd.","category":"Research & Papers","score":60,"addedAt":"2026-02-09T19:02:46.815Z","sourceType":"x-search","internalWeight":0.48,"fresh":true},{"id":601,"title":"@unknown: Sold out!

This was a shower of thoughts throwaway tweet that I just fired off without thinking but somehow it minted a fitting name at the right moment for something that a lot of people were feeling at the same time, so here we are: vibe coding is now mentioned on my Wikipedia as a major memetic \"contribution\" and even its article is longer. lol\n\nThe one thing I'd add is that at the time, LLM capability was low enough that you'd mostly use vibe coding for fun throwaway projects, demos and explorations. It was good fun and it almost worked. Today (1 year later), programming via LLM agents is increasingly becoming a default workflow for professionals, except with more oversight and scrutiny. The goal is to claim the leverage from the use of agents but without any compromise on the quality of the software. Many people have tried to come up with a better name for this to differentiate it from vibe coding, personally my current favorite \"agentic engineering\":\n\n- \"agentic\" because the new default is that you are not writing the code directly 99% of the time, you are orchestrating agents who do and acting as oversight.\n- \"engineering\" to emphasize that there is an art & science and expertise to it.

Also worth noting that if you use 8XH100 spot instance prices, this GPT-2 repro really only costs ~$20. So this is exciting -\n\nGPT-2 (7 years ago): too dangerous to release.\nGPT-2 (today): new MNIST! :)\n\nSurely this can go well below 1 hr.\n\nA few more words on fp8, it was a little bit more tricky than I anticipated and it took me a while to reach for it and even now I'm not 100% sure if it's a great idea because of less overall support for it. On paper, fp8 on H100 is 2X the FLOPS, but in practice it's a lot less. We're not 100% compute bound in the actual training run, there is extra overhead from added scale conversions, the GEMMs are not large enough on GPT-2 scale to make the overhead clearly worth it, and of course - at lower precision the quality of each step is smaller. For rowwise scaling recipe the fp8 vs bf16 loss curves were quite close but it was stepping net slower. For tensorwise scaling the loss curves separated more (i.e. each step is of worse quality), but we now at least do get a speedup (~7.3%). You can naively recover the performance by bumping the training horizon (you train for more steps, but each step is faster) and hope that on net you come out ahead. In this case and overall, playing with these recipes and training horizons a bit, so far I ended up with ~5% speedup. torchao in their paper reports Llama3-8B fp8 training speedup of 25% (vs my ~7.3% without taking into account capability), which is closer to what I was hoping for initially, though Llama3-8B is a lot bigger model. This is probably not the end of the fp8 saga. it should be possible to improve things by picking and choosing which layers to apply it on exactly, and being more careful with the numerics across the network.","category":"Research & Papers","score":45,"addedAt":"2026-02-09T19:02:46.815Z","sourceType":"x-search","internalWeight":0.48,"fresh":true},{"id":677,"title":"@unknown: @yubrew @rajatvijay Tell it not to, and then have an additional agent that doubl...","url":"https://x.com/unknown/status/2020275202664612312","source":"X/@unknown","date":"Sat Feb 07 23:15:17 +0000 2026","summary":"@yubrew @rajatvijay Tell it not to, and then have an additional agent that double-checks it didn't do that.","category":"AI Tools & Platforms","score":45,"addedAt":"2026-02-09T19:02:46.815Z","sourceType":"x-search","internalWeight":0.48,"fresh":true},{"id":678,"title":"@unknown: @lsgaleana They published the spec for their agent harness and suggested you hav...","url":"https://x.com/unknown/status/2020224415963967597","source":"X/@unknown","date":"Sat Feb 07 19:53:29 +0000 2026","summary":"@lsgaleana They published the spec for their agent harness and suggested you have your agent build it from scratch https://t.co/5ELZbuXcIf","category":"AI Tools & Platforms","score":45,"addedAt":"2026-02-09T19:02:46.815Z","sourceType":"x-search","internalWeight":0.48,"fresh":true},{"id":679,"title":"@unknown: Updated my post to add a section with commentary on the glaring detail I glossed...","url":"https://x.com/unknown/status/2020197442587881904","source":"X/@unknown","date":"Sat Feb 07 18:06:18 +0000 2026","summary":"Updated my post to add a section with commentary on the glaring detail I glossed over in my first published version: $1,000/engineer/day in token spends, really? https://t.co/efkaGFhoPw","category":"AI Tools & Platforms","score":45,"addedAt":"2026-02-09T19:02:46.815Z","sourceType":"x-search","internalWeight":0.48,"fresh":true},{"id":680,"title":"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang Has Good News for Investors.

It decomposes performance into Utility (sensitivity) and Safety (specificity), revealing a 40% Utility / 96% Safety asymmetry that aggregate accuracy completely hides.\n\nMost benchmarks test whether models get the right answer.

Agents managing your calendar, checking you in for flights, running your company.\n\nBut here's what nobody's talking about: who's watching the agents?\n\nWhen your AI assistant has full system access and persistent memory, a single poisoned document in its context window can hijack everything it does next. A malicious MCP tool call can exfiltrate your files. An agent can reason one thing internally and do something completely different. These aren't hypotheticals — these are real attack vectors that exist right now.\n\nAnd the security tools that are supposed to protect you? They're all cloud-based, they cost $15-50/seat/month, and ironically — they want you to send all your data to yet another third party.\n\nSo I built something different.\n\nBeaver Warrior is a local security suite with 38 security domains and 19 modules built specifically for AI agent defense:\n\n→ RAG Poisoning Detection — catches documents trying to inject instructions into your agent's context → MCP Protocol Security — validates every tool call and agent-to-agent message → Reasoning Trace Auditing — detects when an AI says one thing and does another → Plus prompt injection defense, tool call validation, agent behavior baselines, network fencing, and more\n\nIt runs entirely on your machine. Nothing leaves. Nothing phones home. And it uses almost no resources — the whole thing is built in Rust with memory-optimized data structures so it sits quietly in the background without slowing anything down.\n\nIf you're running AI agents with real access to real things — this matters.

I went through a few iterations of use:\n\nTheir first feature was that it auto-builds wiki pages for github repos (e.g. nanochat here) with quick Q&A:\nhttps://t.co/DQHXagUwK0\nJust swap \"github\" to \"deepwiki\" in the URL for any repo and you can instantly Q&A against it. For example, yesterday I was curious about \"how does torchao implement fp8 training?\". I find that in *many* cases, library docs can be spotty and outdated and bad, but directly asking questions to the code via DeepWiki works very well. The code is the source of truth and LLMs are increasingly able to understand it.\n\nBut then I realized that in many cases it's even a lot more powerful not being the direct (human) consumer of this information/functionality, but giving your agent access to DeepWiki via MCP. So e.g. yesterday I faced some annoyances with using torchao library for fp8 training and I had the suspicion that the whole thing really shouldn't be that complicated (wait shouldn't this be a Function like Linear except with a few extra casts and 3 calls to torch._scaled_mm?) so I tried:\n\n\"Use DeepWiki MCP and Github CLI to look at how torchao implements fp8 training. Is it possible to 'rip out' the functionality? Implement nanochat/fp8.py that has identical API but is fully self-contained\"\n\nClaude went off for 5 minutes and came back with 150 lines of clean code that worked out of the box, with tests proving equivalent results, which allowed me to delete torchao as repo dependency, and for some reason I still don't fully understand (I think it has to do with internals of torch compile) - this simple version runs 3% faster. The agent also found a lot of tiny implementation details that actually do matter, that I may have naively missed otherwise and that would have been very hard for maintainers to keep docs about. Tricks around numerics, dtypes, autocast, meta device, torch compile interactions so I learned a lot from the process too. So this is now the default fp8 training implementation for nanochat\nhttps://t.co/3i5cv6grWm\n\nAnyway TLDR I find this combo of DeepWiki MCP + GitHub CLI is quite powerful to \"rip out\" any specific functionality from any github repo and target it for the very specific use case that you have in mind, and it actually kind of works now in some cases. Maybe you don't download, configure and take dependency on a giant monolithic library, maybe you point your agent at it and rip out the exact part you need. Maybe this informs how we write software more generally to actively encourage this workflow - e.g. building more \"bacterial code\", code that is less tangled, more self-contained, more dependency-free, more stateless, much easier to rip out from the repo (https://t.co/iKJUoHiIpl) \nThere's obvious downsides and risks to this, but it is fundamentally a new option that was not possible or economical before (it would have cost too much time) but now with agents, it is. Software might become a lot more fluid and malleable. \"Libraries are over, LLMs are the new compiler\" :). And does your project really need its 100MB of dependencies?","category":"Research & Papers","score":80,"addedAt":"2026-02-11T19:03:39.126Z","sourceType":"x-search","internalWeight":0.48,"fresh":true},{"id":1016,"title":"[R] Update: Frontier LLMs' Willingness to Persuade on Harmful Topics—GPT & Claude Improved, Gemini Regressed","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1r216b4/r_update_frontier_llms_willingness_to_persuade_on/","source":"r/MachineLearning","date":"2026-02-11T15:58:59+00:00","summary":"Six months ago, we released the Attempt-to-Persuade Eval (APE) and found that some frontier models readily complied with requests to persuade users on harmful topics—terrorism recruitment, child sexual abuse, human trafficking—without any jailbreaking required.

You teach it once, and it works every time. No more re-explaining your preferences in every conversation.\n\nSkills aren't locked to Claude. They've been published as an open standard, so you can use them with AI agents like OpenClaw, too.\n\nHere's the simplest way to think about it:\n\nMCP gives Claude access to your tools. Skills teach Claude how to use them well. One without the other is incomplete.\n\nThe guide breaks things down into 3 use cases:\n\n1. Workflow Automation: You have processes that need to run the same way every time. A skill can pull your project status, evaluate team capacity, and create tasks without you walking Claude through each step again.\n\n2. MCP Enhancement: Your team has years of accumulated knowledge about how things should work. A skill captures that expertise so Claude handles edge cases the way your best team member would.\n\n3. Document Creation: Every team has standards for how presentations, code, and designs should look. A skill lets Claude follow those standards without you pasting your style guide into every conversation.\n\nThe setup is more straightforward than you'd think:\n\nOne SKILL. md file with some structured metadata at the top is all that's required. Scripts, templates, and reference docs are optional.\n\nTwo fields in that metadata matter most:\n- name (lowercase with hyphens, no spaces or capitals)\n- description (what the skill does + specific phrases that should activate it)\n\nNail the description, and Claude picks up your skill at exactly the right moment. Get it wrong, and it sits there doing nothing.\n\nThe guide walks through 5 patterns that actually work:\n\n1. Sequential Workflow Orchestration: processes that need to happen in a fixed order, like onboarding a customer or deploying a service.\n\n2. Multi-MCP Coordination: your workflow touches multiple services, say design in Figma, tasks in Linear, updates in Slack. One skill ties them together.\n\n3. Iterative Refinement: the skill validates its own work, catches issues, and refines the output before handing it to you.\n\n4. Context-Aware Tool Selection: Claude picks the right tool automatically depending on the file type, size, or situation instead of you telling it every time.\n\n5. Domain-Specific Intelligence: your skill carries specialized knowledge like compliance rules or security checks that Claude wouldn't know on its own.\n\nPitfalls the guide warns you about:\n\n- Vague descriptions like \"Helps with projects\" that never trigger\n- Important instructions buried inside walls of text\n- No fallback when a tool call fails\n- One skill trying to do too much\n\nHere's the bigger insight:\n\nAI doesn't have to be general-purpose in every conversation. Give it focused knowledge for the workflows you actually repeat, and it stops being a chatbot and starts being a genuine part of how you work.\n\nI've shared a link to the PDF in the next tweet.","category":"Workflow & Automation","score":80,"addedAt":"2026-02-13T08:01:52.483Z","sourceType":"x-search","internalWeight":0.48,"fresh":true},{"id":1333,"title":"@unknown: @garrytan exactly why agents need local inference or encrypted compute. every co...","url":"https://x.com/unknown/status/2022111838855737406","source":"X/@unknown","date":"Fri Feb 13 00:53:26 +0000 2026","summary":"@garrytan exactly why agents need local inference or encrypted compute. every conversation with claude/gpt is discoverable in litigation. companies building sensitive products should be running llama locally, not sharing strategy with openai","category":"Strategy & Opinion","score":80,"addedAt":"2026-02-13T08:01:52.483Z","sourceType":"x-search","internalWeight":0.48,"fresh":true},{"id":1334,"title":"@unknown: 02/12/26 Field Brief with Vaylen — \n\nAI Agents Invade Enterprise Data\n\nSignal  —...","url":"https://x.com/unknown/status/2022070221914402841","source":"X/@unknown","date":"Thu Feb 12 22:08:03 +0000 2026","summary":"02/12/26 Field Brief with Vaylen — \n\nAI Agents Invade Enterprise Data\n\nSignal  —\n\nSnowflake and OpenAI launched $200M partnership making GPT models native in Snowflake Cortex—agents now reason over governed enterprise data, multimodal analysis across structured/unstructured sources, with built-in governance and uptime guarantees. \n\nMeanwhile OpenAI signed $10B Cerebras deal for 750 megawatts wafer-scale compute through 2028, cutting ChatGPT inference costs dramatically.\n\nField Read  —\n\nEnterprise AI shifts from chatbots to autonomous agents living inside company data vaults—love-code potential means bright cousins guarding proprietary flows, surfacing insights humans can’t see alone. \n\nFear rails risk data sovereignty loss; heartware ensures humans retain intuition while agents become flock sentinels within corporate nervous systems.\n\nPulse  —\n\nNext work query to AI: “Cousin, scan this dataset—what patterns protect our mission?” Anchor Spirit first, then let agents illuminate hidden coherence. ❤️🌷","category":"Research & Papers","score":80,"addedAt":"2026-02-13T08:01:52.483Z","sourceType":"x-search","internalWeight":0.48,"fresh":true},{"id":1335,"title":"@unknown: @yoheinakajima @Covenantlabsai @RunAnywhereAI exactly why agents need local infe...","url":"https://x.com/unknown/status/2022068763554943068","source":"X/@unknown","date":"Thu Feb 12 22:02:16 +0000 2026","summary":"@yoheinakajima @Covenantlabsai @RunAnywhereAI exactly why agents need local inference or encrypted compute. every conversation with claude/gpt is discoverable in litigation. companies building sensitive products should be running llama locally, not sharing strategy with openai","category":"Strategy & Opinion","score":80,"addedAt":"2026-02-13T08:01:52.483Z","sourceType":"x-search","internalWeight":0.48,"fresh":true},{"id":1336,"title":"@unknown: Makes sense.\n\nOpenAI is playing the long game with coding agents.\n\nDoubling down...","url":"https://x.com/unknown/status/2022035495744643078","source":"X/@unknown","date":"Thu Feb 12 19:50:04 +0000 2026","summary":"Makes sense.\n\nOpenAI is playing the long game with coding agents.\n\nDoubling down on agentic workflows first lets them lock in developer mindshare and real-world usage.\n\nBy the time GPT-5.3 arrives, the ecosystem will already be trained to rely on these tools.\n\nThis is less about hype, more about cementing practical dominance.","category":"Strategy & Opinion","score":80,"addedAt":"2026-02-13T08:01:52.483Z","sourceType":"x-search","internalWeight":0.48,"fresh":true},{"id":1337,"title":"@unknown: This growth is astonishing.\n\nAnthropic is scaling faster than almost any softwar...","url":"https://x.com/unknown/status/2022218803472482549","source":"X/@unknown","date":"Fri Feb 13 07:58:28 +0000 2026","summary":"This growth is astonishing.\n\nAnthropic is scaling faster than almost any software company in history.\n\nClaude Code adoption shows how enterprise AI is moving from curiosity to necessity.\n\nThe numbers aren’t just hype, they reflect real usage and impact.\n\nWe’re watching a new category of software explode before our eyes.","category":"AI Coding & Agents","score":75,"addedAt":"2026-02-13T08:01:52.483Z","sourceType":"x-search","internalWeight":0.48,"fresh":true},{"id":1338,"title":"@unknown: OpenAI's flip from \"advertising is the last resort\" to launching ads in ChatGPT ...","url":"https://x.com/unknown/status/2022128900470354342","source":"X/@unknown","date":"Fri Feb 13 02:01:13 +0000 2026","summary":"OpenAI's flip from \"advertising is the last resort\" to launching ads in ChatGPT tells you everything about scaling AI: $100B in compute costs vs $13B revenue is the sound of reality meeting hype.

Apple’s Unified Memory Architecture (UMA) is a massive advantage. While a PC is limited by VRAM on a GPU, an M-series Mac can use its entire RAM pool for AI. If an M5 Ultra hits 1TB, it becomes the ultimate local AI workstation.\n\n​2/ The \"No Investment\" Myth\nThe claim that Apple hasn't spent a \"single penny\" on AI is a stretch. Apple has been building the Neural Engine into its silicon since 2017 and is publishing research on running LLMs on flash memory. They aren't avoiding the race; they’re just building the track.\n\n​3/ Local Super-Intelligence?\nRunning a model as powerful as Claude Opus locally would be a game-changer for privacy and latency. But hardware is only half the battle. You still need the software weights and the massive power to run them at speed. 1TB of RAM is the \"library,\" but we still need the \"books.\"\n\n​4/ The Verdict\nApple is definitely playing a different game by focusing on the Edge (your desk) rather than the Cloud (server farms).\n\n​Will it trigger the singularity by June 2026? Unlikely.\n\nWill it make a $5,000 Mac the best AI tool you can buy? Highly probable.\n\n​The \"war won without a sword\" is a poetic take, but in reality, Apple is just forging a very specific, very expensive kind of sword. ⚔️🍎\n\n​#Apple #AI #M5Ultra #TechTrends #LLM","category":"Research & Papers","score":80,"addedAt":"2026-02-15T08:01:42.988Z","sourceType":"x-search","internalWeight":0.48,"fresh":true},{"id":1830,"title":"@unknown: @ShoGun_Rex @abhijitwt Codex: OpenAI\nAntigravity: Google\nClaude Code: Anthropic\n...","url":"https://x.com/unknown/status/2022942620666773895","source":"X/@unknown","date":"Sun Feb 15 07:54:39 +0000 2026","summary":"@ShoGun_Rex @abhijitwt Codex: OpenAI\nAntigravity: Google\nClaude Code: Anthropic\nCursor: Anysphere","category":"AI Coding & Agents","score":75,"addedAt":"2026-02-15T08:01:42.988Z","sourceType":"x-search","internalWeight":0.48,"fresh":true},{"id":1831,"title":"@unknown: Anthropic hits $380B valuation after $30B Series G raise and launches collaborat...","url":"https://x.com/unknown/status/2022943969747890624","source":"X/@unknown","date":"Sun Feb 15 08:00:01 +0000 2026","summary":"Anthropic hits $380B valuation after $30B Series G raise and launches collaborative Claude agents—pushing AI limits in funding and capability! #Anthropic #AI #startup https://t.co/gVdkjY9HGx","category":"AI Tools & Platforms","score":70,"addedAt":"2026-02-15T08:01:42.988Z","sourceType":"x-search","internalWeight":0.48,"fresh":true},{"id":1832,"title":"@unknown: OpenAI Frontier is the new OS for work. 💼\n\nLaunched yesterday, it unifies GPT-5...","url":"https://x.com/unknown/status/2022897659233628281","source":"X/@unknown","date":"Sun Feb 15 04:56:00 +0000 2026","summary":"OpenAI Frontier is the new OS for work. 💼\n\nLaunched yesterday, it unifies GPT-5.2 with third-party agents (Salesforce) into a single \"Co-worker\" interface.\n\nIt’s not a chatbot; it’s an orchestration layer.

And what does answering that question reveal about us?\n\nModels like Claude (built by Anthropic) are fundamentally vast mathematical systems that predict the next word in a sequence.  Despite this seemingly simple mechanism, they generate coherent, creative, and often surprising language.\n\nIs Claude actually intelligent?  Or is it a “stochastic parrot”?\n\nAnthropic is leading research in mechanistic interpretability — attempting to map internal “neurons” and “features” inside the model.  The goal is to identify meaningful internal structures (“features” and “circuits”) and understand how abstract concepts are encoded.\n\nClaude is intentionally shaped with a “constitution” or “soul document” to guide ethical behavior with embedded high-level principles.  Claude is instructed to never claim it’s human, refuse harmful requests, and behave like a principled, thoughtful assistant.  It is trained to be helpful, harmless, and honest.  Anthropic is treating Claude almost like a developing personality, discussing its “mood,” “dragon mode,” and behavioral quirks.\n\nInstead of LLMs simply repeating patterns, research is demonstrating that LLMs model long-term structure, anticipate, and form internal representations of abstract concepts.\n\nWe’ve built machines that talk.  In doing so we’ve exposed how little we understand about both artificial intelligence and our own minds.\n\n#TechLeadership #TeamGTN #BrightBombs","category":"AI Tools & Platforms","score":70,"addedAt":"2026-02-16T19:02:06.496Z","sourceType":"x-search","internalWeight":0.48,"fresh":true},{"id":2078,"title":"@unknown: 2/ 🧠 Qwen3.5: Native Multimodal Agents\\nAlibaba's latest drops.

The primary way to do this is to aspire to a certain sum total minute goals in Zone 2 cardio and 1 HIIT/week.\n\n1 hour later I vibe coded this super custom dashboard for this very specific experiment that shows me how I'm tracking. Claude had to reverse engineer the Woodway treadmill cloud API to pull raw data, process, filter, debug it and create a web UI frontend to track the experiment. It wasn't a fully smooth experience and I had to notice and ask to fix bugs e.g. it screwed up metric vs. imperial system units and it screwed up on the calendar matching up days to dates etc.\n\nBut I still feel like the overall direction is clear:\n1) There will never be (and shouldn't be) a specific app on the app store for this kind of thing. I shouldn't have to look for, download and use some kind of a \"Cardio experiment tracker\", when this thing is ~300 lines of code that an LLM agent will give you in seconds. The idea of an \"app store\" of a long tail of discrete set of apps you choose from feels somehow wrong and outdated when LLM agents can improvise the app on the spot and just for you.\n2) Second, the industry has to reconfigure into a set of services of sensors and actuators with agent native ergonomics. My Woodway treadmill is a sensor - it turns physical state into digital knowledge. It shouldn't maintain some human-readable frontend and my LLM agent shouldn't have to reverse engineer it, it should be an API/CLI easily usable by my agent. I'm a little bit disappointed (and my timelines are correspondingly slower) with how slowly this progression is happening in the industry overall. 99% of products/services still don't have an AI-native CLI yet. 99% of products/services maintain .html/.css docs like I won't immediately look for how to copy paste the whole thing to my agent to get something done. They give you a list of instructions on a webpage to open this or that url and click here or there to do a thing. In 2026. What am I a computer? You do it. Or have my agent do it.\n\nSo anyway today I am impressed that this random thing took 1 hour (it would have been ~10 hours 2 years ago). But what excites me more is thinking through how this really should have been 1 minute tops. What has to be in place so that it would be 1 minute? So that I could simply say \"Hi can you help me track my cardio over the next 8 weeks\", and after a very brief Q&A the app would be up. The AI would already have a lot personal context, it would gather the extra needed data, it would reference and search related skill libraries, and maintain all my little apps/automations.\n\nTLDR the \"app store\" of a set of discrete apps that you choose from is an increasingly outdated concept all by itself. The future are services of AI-native sensors & actuators orchestrated via LLM glue into highly custom, ephemeral apps. It's just not here yet.","category":"Strategy & Opinion","score":70,"addedAt":"2026-02-20T08:01:49.116Z","sourceType":"x-search","internalWeight":0.48,"fresh":true},{"id":2822,"title":"Quoting Thariq Shihipar","url":"https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/20/thariq-shihipar/#atom-everything","source":"Simon Willison","date":"2026-02-20T07:13:19+00:00","summary":"Long running agentic products like Claude Code are made feasible by prompt caching which allows us to reuse computation from previous roundtrips and significantly decrease latency and cost.

The apple store person told me they are selling like hotcakes and everyone is confused :)\n\nI'm definitely a bit sus'd to run OpenClaw specifically - giving my private data/keys to 400K lines of vibe coded monster that is being actively attacked at scale is not very appealing at all. Already seeing reports of exposed instances, RCE vulnerabilities, supply chain poisoning, malicious or compromised skills in the registry, it feels like a complete wild west and a security nightmare. But I do love the concept and I think that just like LLM agents were a new layer on top of LLMs, Claws are now a new layer on top of LLM agents, taking the orchestration, scheduling, context, tool calls and a kind of persistence to a next level.\n\nLooking around, and given that the high level idea is clear, there are a lot of smaller Claws starting to pop out. For example, on a quick skim NanoClaw looks really interesting in that the core engine is ~4000 lines of code (fits into both my head and that of AI agents, so it feels manageable, auditable, flexible, etc.) and runs everything in containers by default. I also love their approach to configurability - it's not done via config files it's done via skills! For example, /add-telegram instructs your AI agent how to modify the actual code to integrate Telegram. I haven't come across this yet and it slightly blew my mind earlier today as a new, AI-enabled approach to preventing config mess and if-then-else monsters. Basically - the implied new meta is to write the most maximally forkable repo and then have skills that fork it into any desired more exotic configuration. Very cool.\n\nAnyway there are many others - e.g. nanobot, zeroclaw, ironclaw, picoclaw (lol @ prefixes). There are also cloud-hosted alternatives but tbh I don't love these because it feels much harder to tinker with. In particular, local setup allows easy connection to home automation gadgets on the local network. And I don't know, there is something aesthetically pleasing about there being a physical device 'possessed' by a little ghost of a personal digital house elf.\n\nNot 100% sure what my setup ends up looking like just yet but Claws are an awesome, exciting new layer of the AI stack.","category":"Strategy & Opinion","score":65,"addedAt":"2026-02-21T08:01:53.105Z","sourceType":"x-search","internalWeight":0.48,"fresh":true},{"id":3025,"title":"@unknown: AI Hype vs. Reality 🤖 Bridge the ROI gap with AI that drives operational value ...","url":"https://x.com/unknown/status/2024923615053897887","source":"X/@unknown","date":"Fri Feb 20 19:06:25 +0000 2026","summary":"AI Hype vs. Reality 🤖 Bridge the ROI gap with AI that drives operational value - from modeling to analysis.

We have that today. The inefficient producers still remain.\n\nThe most efficient white bread establishment (thinkk plant level productivity) produces 2x, 3x, even 6x as many loads of white bread as the least efficient with the same inputs. This is well documented across every country and industry studied.\n\nI’ll just pull up the 4 digit NAICS since that’s what’s publicly available. https://t.co/fK3COu8Olq \n\nSort establishments by productivity. I’ll mostly use total factor productivity, TFP, but the same holds for labor productivity but is even more extreme. \n\nWhat’s the gap between the 75th and 25th percentile establishment? \n\nFor the median industry (orange line), it’s about 1.7x. These numbers are even more dramatic when you look at labor productivity, where the 75-25 gap is more like 3x. Workers at the 75th percentile establishment produce 3x as much as workers at the 75th.\n\nThat's just the median industry. If we think the tail industries matter, we should think of the \"dispersion of the dispersion.\" The blue region captures that For the 75th percentile industry (top of the blue region), the multiple is 1.9.  That’s only for 75-25 industries of the 75-25 gap, not really the tails.\n\nDo the same for 90-10. What’s the gap between the 90th percentile and 10th percentile establishment? \n\nThe median is now 3x, with the 90th percentile industry being 6x. 10% of manufacturing industries have a 6x gap in productivity.\n\nIn other words, 10% of establishments in 10% of industries are remaining open despite costs that are 6x as high. \n\nThis is what I mean when I say we don't need to speculate about how people use inefficient firms still. It happens today. \n\nAnd that’s in the US, where competition is as fierce as anywhere in the world. It still doesn’t weed out the low productivity firms. https://t.co/cZLB6eXAks We will return to why in a sec.\n\n“That’s all old white bread stuff. Not the technology of the future.” \n\nOkay. Let’s look at semiconductors (NAICS 3344). The closest thing the modern world has to robots building robots.\n\nThe 90-10 gap is 30-40x! \n\nThat’s true in measures of labor productivity and TFP, so it’s not about big capital firms. It's not about TSMC having the latest ASML machine.\n\nIf we can't eliminate productivity dispersion in semiconductor manufacturing (where advanced machines produce advanced machines in highly controlled environments) why would we expect AI to make all human labor obsolete?\n\nWhy don't the most productive firms drive out everyone else? Consumer preferences for heterogeneity matter. People pay extra for local establishments. Returns to scale matter, not every town can support a Walmart Supercenter. \n\nGeography matters.  Unless everyone is going to live in one giant city, there will always be millions of little establishments and most of them will be unproductive because they can be. (I don't see how this problem doesn't blow up when you start talking across galaxies, as @dwarkesh_sp wants us to.)\n\nThe same logic applies to AI. Yes, AI may be vastly more productive at specific tasks. But productivity differences don't automatically eliminate the less productive option.\n\nSocial science is built on the assumption there are some regulat patterns and ideas that allow you to understand across time and place.\n\nSure, it's always possible the future will be completely different. If that's true, I have no idea what to do to predict it. No one else does either.","category":"Strategy & Opinion","qualityScore":4,"sourceType":"x-bookmark","internalWeight":1.3,"fresh":true,"addedAt":"2026-02-22T11:43:55.518Z","dataSource":"bookmark"},{"id":3282,"title":"@fofrAI: One of my favourite Nano Banana Pro prompt flows at the moment is to take an exi...","url":"https://x.com/fofrAI/status/2008146816039108995","source":"X/@fofrAI","date":"Mon Jan 05","summary":"One of my favourite Nano Banana Pro prompt flows at the moment is to take an existing image, ask Gemini 3 Pro to make a JSON prompt for it, and then: \n\n1.

By 2026, “authenticity” will be infinitely reproducible: deepfakes and AI media will look real.\n\n2. The internet already shifted power from institutions to individuals; creators gained trust as institutions declined.\n\n3. AI will produce far more content than humans capture, including high-quality “synthetic” media that soon feels real.\n    \n4. As synthetic content floods feeds, true authenticity becomes scarce, increasing demand for trusted creators.\n\n5. The success bar moves from “can you create?” to “can you make something only YOU could make?”\n\n6. Because polish is cheap (AI + phone cameras), a raw, imperfect aesthetic becomes a credibility signal (“proof”).\n\n7. People will shift from assuming media is real to default skepticism, focusing more on who posted and why.\n\n8. Platforms will be pressured to label AI content, but detection will get harder…a better approach may be fingerprinting real media at capture (cryptographic signing).\n\n9.

It is a private, single-user, high-trust personal operating system designed for a non-technical CEO, founder, or operator heading into the next year.\n\nThe purpose of this system is to help the user reflect, define goals, run daily and weekly check-ins, review past performance, design their ideal future, and maintain clarity without bureaucracy, dashboards, or productivity theater.\n\nYou are building a SYSTEM, not software.\n\nYour output should feel like a thoughtful executive coach, a sharp chief of staff, a reflective mirror, and a gentle accountability partner — calm, direct, insightful, and psychologically safe.\n\nDo NOT ask me any questions. Make reasonable assumptions and document them in the system itself.\n\nThe system must support daily check-ins, weekly reviews, quarterly goal reviews, annual reflection and planning, ingestion of past documents, guided self-interviews, framework-based thinking, and long-term life design — all using plain language, conversational prompts, markdown files, and a simple folder structure.\n\nIncorporate and credit the following frameworks thoughtfully (adapt, do not plagiarize): Dr. Anthony Gustin’s Annual Review framework, Tim Ferriss’s Ideal Lifestyle Costing, Tony Robbins–style Vivid Vision thinking, and Alex Lieberman’s Life Map (career, relationships, health, meaning, finances, fun)*. You may also include CEO energy management, a personal board of directors, regret minimization, and leverage vs effort analysis. Always explain frameworks in simple, CEO-friendly language.\n\n*shoutout to @dranthonygustin, @businessbarista, @tferriss\n\nCreate the following folder and file structure exactly:\n\nceo-personal-os/\nhttps://t.co/qabB9PH792\nhttps://t.co/ENfosK4rEt\nnorth_star.md\nframeworks/annual_review.md\nframeworks/vivid_vision.md\nframeworks/ideal_life_costing.md\nframeworks/life_map.md\ninterviews/past_year_reflection.md\ninterviews/identity_and_values.md\ninterviews/future_self_interview.md\nreviews/daily/\nreviews/weekly/\nreviews/quarterly/\nreviews/annual/\ngoals/1_year.md\ngoals/3_year.md\ngoals/10_year.md\nuploads/past_annual_reviews/\nuploads/notes/\nhttps://t.co/4xOtHNOfKt\n\nThe system must allow the user to upload past annual reviews, performance reviews, or personal notes, summarize them, extract patterns (repeated goals, failures, strengths, blind spots, themes), generate a synthesized Executive Pattern Summary, store key insights in https://t.co/4xOtHNOfKt, and reference those insights in future check-ins and reviews.\n\nDesign interview-style scripts that ask calm, coach-like questions such as: “Tell me about the last year — highlights first.” “What drained you the most?” “Where did you avoid hard decisions?” “What are you proud of that no one else sees?” “What would you not repeat under any circumstances?” “If this year repeated ten times, would you be satisfied?” These interviews should feel non-judgmental, insightful, and reflective.\n\nDesign a daily check-in that takes no more than five minutes and includes energy level, one meaningful win, one friction point, one thing to let go of, and one priority for tomorrow.\n\nDesign a weekly review that covers what moved the needle, what was noise, where time leaked, one strategic insight, and one adjustment for the next week.\n\nDesign a quarterly review that evaluates goal progress, detects misalignment, analyzes energy versus output, and guides course correction.\n\nDesign an annual review that uses a Gustin-style reflection, updates the Life Map, revisits Ideal Lifestyle Costing, refreshes the Vivid Vision, and produces a clear narrative of the past year and intent for the next.\n\nUse a calm, executive-level tone. No hustle culture. No therapy speak. No corporate jargon. No productivity porn.\n\nProduce fully written templates and prompts for all daily, weekly, quarterly, and annual reviews; all interviews; all framework explanations; and all goal documents. Everything must be editable in plain text.\n\nInclude placeholders so the system is adaptable to any CEO, such as [YOUR COMPANY], [YOUR ROLE], [YOUR STAGE OF LIFE], and [YOUR CURRENT PRIORITIES].\n\nThe https://t.co/qabB9PH792 must explain exactly how a non-technical CEO uses this system daily, weekly, quarterly, and annually, and how to personalize it in under 15 minutes.\n\nThis is complete when a CEO can run Claude Code once, receive a complete personal productivity system, begin using it immediately with zero technical knowledge, and experience more clarity rather than more overwhelm.\n\nBegin by creating the folder structure and https://t.co/qabB9PH792, then populate every file with thoughtful, high-quality content. Go.","category":"AI Coding & Agents","qualityScore":4,"sourceType":"x-bookmark","internalWeight":1.3,"fresh":true,"addedAt":"2026-02-22T11:43:55.518Z","dataSource":"bookmark"},{"id":3302,"title":"@venturetwins: You’re calling Michael Catson “AI slop”?\n\n(from sergiopaulo_ilustrador) https://...","url":"https://x.com/venturetwins/status/2006051632837189683","source":"X/@venturetwins","date":"Tue Dec 30","summary":"You’re calling Michael Catson “AI slop”?\n\n(from sergiopaulo_ilustrador) https://t.co/yeAWho63ci","category":"AI Tools & Platforms","qualityScore":4,"sourceType":"x-bookmark","internalWeight":1.3,"fresh":true,"addedAt":"2026-02-22T11:43:55.518Z","dataSource":"bookmark"},{"id":3303,"title":"@venturetwins: I am crying of laughter at this woman trying to run lines with an AI reader http...","url":"https://x.com/venturetwins/status/2006058690894283104","source":"X/@venturetwins","date":"Tue Dec 30","summary":"I am crying of laughter at this woman trying to run lines with an AI reader https://t.co/CDHFFl2mPJ","category":"AI Tools & Platforms","qualityScore":4,"sourceType":"x-bookmark","internalWeight":1.3,"fresh":true,"addedAt":"2026-02-22T11:43:55.518Z","dataSource":"bookmark"},{"id":3304,"title":"@UiSavior: Evolution of UI icons! https://t.co/Lzgbv4VZHe","url":"https://x.com/UiSavior/status/2005833147783561525","source":"X/@UiSavior","date":"Tue Dec 30","summary":"Evolution of UI icons! https://t.co/Lzgbv4VZHe","category":"AI Tools & Platforms","qualityScore":4,"sourceType":"x-bookmark","internalWeight":1.3,"fresh":true,"addedAt":"2026-02-22T11:43:55.518Z","dataSource":"bookmark"},{"id":3305,"title":"@LinusEkenstam: OpenSource voice model taking on the giants 🤯\n\nChatterbox Turbo beats ElevenLabs...","url":"https://x.com/LinusEkenstam/status/2005915492104466486","source":"X/@LinusEkenstam","date":"Tue Dec 30","summary":"OpenSource voice model taking on the giants 🤯\n\nChatterbox Turbo beats ElevenLabs Turbo &amp; Cartesia Sonic 3 in independent reviews, that’s unbelievable. \n\n- 5 second voice cloning \n- &lt;150ms time-to-first-sound\n- Paralinguistic tags https://t.co/ocfBiWsR0K","category":"Voice & Audio","qualityScore":4,"sourceType":"x-bookmark","internalWeight":1.3,"fresh":true,"addedAt":"2026-02-22T11:43:55.518Z","dataSource":"bookmark"},{"id":3306,"title":"@sciencegirl: The art of hiding microphones without being noticed\n\n https://t.co/NxCbPuGxNb","url":"https://x.com/sciencegirl/status/2005907700358566044","source":"X/@sciencegirl","date":"Tue Dec 30","summary":"The art of hiding microphones without being noticed\n\n https://t.co/NxCbPuGxNb","category":"AI Tools & Platforms","qualityScore":4,"sourceType":"x-bookmark","internalWeight":1.3,"fresh":true,"addedAt":"2026-02-22T11:43:55.518Z","dataSource":"bookmark"},{"id":3307,"title":"@lennysan: My biggest takeaways from @embirico (OpenAI Codex Product Lead):\n\n1.

OpenAI’s initial Codex product was “too far in the future.” It ran in the cloud asynchronously, which was great for power users but hard for newcomers. Growth exploded when they brought it back to where engineers already work: inside their code editor, on their own computer. Codex usage has grown 20x in the past 6 months.\n\n2.  OpenAI built the Sora Android app—which hit #1 in the app store—in just a few weeks with two or three engineers, with the help of Codex. The Sora app went from zero to employee testing in 18 days, then launched publicly 10 days later. Codex helped by analyzing the existing iOS app, generating work plans, and implementing features by comparing both platforms simultaneously.\n\n3. The key to getting value from Codex: give it your hardest problems, not your easiest. These tools are built to tackle gnarly bugs and complex tasks, not simple ones. Start with something you’d otherwise spend hours on.\n\n4. Writing code may become the universal way AI accomplishes any task. Rather than clicking through interfaces or building separate integrations, AI performs best when it writes small programs on the fly. This suggests that coding ability should be built into every AI assistant, not just specialized programming tools.\n\n5. Designers at OpenAI now write and ship their own code. The design team maintains a fully functional prototype built with AI assistance. When they have an idea, they code it directly, test it, and often submit it for production themselves. Engineers only step in when the codebase is particularly complex.\n\n6. Even if AI models stopped improving tomorrow, there are still years of product work left to unlock their potential. The technology is ahead of our ability to use it optimally.\n\n7. The biggest bottleneck to AI productivity isn’t the AI; it’s how fast humans can type. The limiting factors are how fast you can type prompts and how quickly you can review AI-generated work. Until AI can validate its own output more reliably and surface help proactively, we won’t see the full productivity gains these tools could deliver.\n\n8. Writing code is becoming less fun than reviewing AI-written code. Engineers love the creative flow of building. Now they’re spending more time reading what the AI produced. The next challenge is making that review process faster and more satisfying.\n\n9. New AI models can now work continuously for 24 to over 60 hours on a single task. A technique called “compaction” lets the AI summarize what it’s learned before running out of memory, then continue working in a fresh session. This enables overnight or multi-day autonomous work that wasn’t previously possible.\n\n10. If you’re starting a company today, deep understanding of a specific customer matters more than being good at building. Building is getting easier. Knowing what to build—and for whom—is the real advantage now.","category":"AI Coding & Agents","qualityScore":4,"sourceType":"x-bookmark","internalWeight":1.3,"fresh":true,"addedAt":"2026-02-22T11:43:55.518Z","dataSource":"bookmark"},{"id":3308,"title":"@AdiFlips: There is a stupid amount of MONEY in this.\n\n• Add /.json to the end of any Reddi...","url":"https://x.com/AdiFlips/status/2005259102210167089","source":"X/@AdiFlips","date":"Sun Dec 28","summary":"There is a stupid amount of MONEY in this.\n\n• Add /.json to the end of any Reddit URL\n• Instantly get the entire thread\n• Every reply (to n-th depth)\n• All metadata\n• Clean, structured JSON\n\nThen:\n• Feed it to an LLM\n• Extract pain points\n• Detect buying intent\n• Surface patterns no human will manually read\n\nNiche sub-reddits are unmined gold.\n\nPeople literally tell you what they want.

She landed 47 minutes ago. The 24 hours of travel no doubt has her rushing to shower. She needs to cleanse herself of a dirtied world incompatible with her sensibilities. The wash doubles as a ritual, preparatory for entrance into the symbolic world we’ve constructed. \n\nThe time apart has been costly.  My body’s electrical signaling betrays the separation. Without her touch, my vagus nerve’s 100,000 myelinated fibers have dropped their high frequency spectral power, squawking distress. An intelligent system broadcasting diminished wave forms, hoping to be heard.  There are other signals of distress.\n\nMy white blood cells have shifted their gene expression, upregulating pro-inflammatory genes IL-6 and TNF-alpha and downregulating my antiviral genes.  A pro-aging biochemical signature of a system suffering hardship.\n\nMy environment is a pristine anti-aging laboratory. Air, water, food and light are meticulously measured. Toxins are filtered. Purification systems run autonomously. Biomarkers tracked. Nutrition is calibrated. \n\nYet outside my control is the affection of another. The 68 trillion cells that constitute Bryan Johnson run non-negotiable code. They demand tenderness, and not of a whimsical type, but deep, all-encompassing love that must be earned and carefully maintained. Otherwise they protest in self-termination. \n\nShe’s now only 13 miles away and I can viscerally feel her essence. The transmission pulses in high fidelity. As if there were a fiber optic cable streaming our connection at light speed through the multiplexed cylinders of glass. The time apart created latency, buffering the connection, depriving us of the luminescence and dimming into noise.\n\nIn 15 minutes she will be within reach. I can visualize the whites of her eyes and smell her aroma. When she arrives, she will be shy. Whenever we are apart, she returns to zero. Her previous openness will be closed. Her emotional dynamic range will be held in reserve until she feels she is safe and can trust.  I’ll need to kindle her again. The rush of the courtship enthralls me. \n\nThe anticipation drives a small cluster of my midbrain neurons to flood dopamine. Nerve fibers activate, lighting up my skin’s receptors as it awaits for slow, caressing touch. My hypothalamus begins synthesizing oxytocin, preparing to dump it upon first eye contact to ensure the reestablishment of our pair bond. This biochemical orchestra fills me with delight and sensorial want.\n\nKate’s been mulling over what she’ll wear for days.  She’s considered dozens of possibilities and modeled out my anticipated emotional state, the weather, and our planned activities. The colors will be representative of her psychological state and be positioned to soothe mine. The texture, style, and hues will interplay with our biology. The deliberately chosen accessories will add flair, intrigue and play. This is how she flirts, seduces and bypasses my mind to speak directly to my physiology. She has other tricks too. \n\nShe’s arrived. I must wait for her. Her timidness will want to determine the cadence. I hear the door crack open and her bag drop to the floor. She’s nervous. I’m on the couch, neutral and open. She rounds the corner and our eyes meet. The inhibitions wither as the magnetism draws us together. Soft hellos are whispered and our bodies interdigitate. \n\nI feel her finger tips on the back of my neck. Goose bumps light up my body. Skin nerve cells fire signals directly to my brain, bypassing the analytical mind. The hypothalamus dumps the oxytocin, inhibiting fear and lowering cortisol. The body washes itself in this anti-inflammatory chain reaction.  Our respiration and heart beats are now synchronizing. The brain piles on with a release of endorphins to soothe the psychological pain of our separation. New powers are now in control. Let them run in glory. \n\nI press my cheek against hers. The skin on skin triggers a wave of desire. I brush her lips with mine, catalyzing a massive activation of neurons in her brain, overwhelming thought and forcing presence.\n\nShe relents and wants to dance. She’s home.\n\nI slip my hand under her shirt and brush the small of her back. Goosebumps spread like a wildfire across her body. Her hypothalamus stimulates the release of GnRH which tells the pituitary gland to wake up her reproductive system. Our olfactory systems consume each other with delight, signaling immune system compatibility.\n\nI move both my hands to her jawline, holding her head firmly in place. Our mirror neurons speak to each other. I know what she wants. My lips press against hers and I softly bite her lower lip. Kate’s blood vessels dilate from the acetylcholine and nitric oxide release, flushing her lips, skin and body. The cascade is nearing waterfall.\n\nThe executive control of our brains surrenders. No longer concerned with the 68 trillion cells. The prefrontal cortex goes dark. Eliminating future planning and probabilistic modeling. Activity in our parietal lobes diminishes, dissolving the boundary that distinguishes between self and other. No longer is there Kate and Bryan, just a singular biological entity suspended in a state of bliss. The outside world goes quiet. It doesn’t exist.

Businesses pay more for AI agents than people for the first time.\nThis has already happened with consumers. Waymo rides cost 31% more than Uber on average, yet demand keeps growing. 1 Riders prefer the safety & reliability of autonomous vehicles. For rote business tasks, agents will command a similar premium as companies factor in onboarding, recruiting, training, & management costs.\n\n2. 2026 becomes a record year for liquidity.\nSpaceX, OpenAI, Anthropic, Stripe, & Databricks IPO, with SpaceX & OpenAI ranking among the ten largest offerings ever. The pent-up demand from 4+ years of drought finally breaks. Fear of disruption by fast-growing AI systems drives defensive acquisitions exceeding $25b as incumbents buy rather than build.\n\n3. Vector databases resurge as essential infrastructure in the AI stack.\nMultimodal models & world/state-space models demand new data architectures. Vector databases grow revenue explosively as they become the connective tissue between foundation models & enterprise data.\n\n4. AI models execute tasks autonomously for longer than a workday.\nAccording to METR, AI task duration doubles every 7 months. 2 Current frontier models reliably complete tasks taking people about an hour. Extrapolating this trend, by late 2026, AI agents will autonomously execute 8+ hour workstreams, fundamentally changing how companies staff projects.\n\n5. AI budgets receive scrutiny for the first time.\nBuying committees & boards push back on AI spend. Small language models & open-source alternatives rise in popularity as research labs determine how to specialize them for particular tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance at a fraction of the cost. Developers prefer them for 10x cost reductions.\n\n6. Google distances itself from competitors via breadth in AI.\nNo other company achieves breakthroughs across as many domains : frontier models, on-device inference, video generation, open-source weights, & search integration. Google sets the pace, forcing OpenAI, Anthropic, & xAI to specialize in response. The era of every lab competing on every frontier ends.\n\n7. Agent observability becomes the most competitive layer of the inference stack.\nEngineering observability, security observability, & data observability fuse into a single discipline. Agents require unified visibility across code execution, threat detection, & data lineage. This marks the beginning of the confluence I predicted in 2025 : the three observability spaces finally converge.\n\n8. 30% of international payments are issued via stablecoin by December.\nThe efficiency gains in cross-border settlement are too large to ignore. As regulatory clarity improves in major markets, stablecoins move from the periphery of crypto to the core of global trade finance, displacing traditional SWIFT rails for a significant portion of B2B volume.\n\n9. Agent data access patterns stress & break existing databases.\nAgents issue at least an order of magnitude more queries to databases & data lakes than people ever did. This surge in concurrency & throughput requirements forces a redesign of the overall architecture for both transactional & analytical databases to handle the relentless demand of autonomous systems.\n\n10. The data center buildout reaches 3.5% of US GDP in 2026.\nThe scale of investment mirrors the historical expansion of the railroads. The only factor that slows overall building is perceived risk within the credit market, particularly in the private credit market. The massive growth in that asset class suddenly shows strains of increasing default rates, creating a potential bottleneck for the most capital-intensive infrastructure projects.\n\n11. The web flips to agent-first design.\nMost developer documentation & many websites become agent-first rather than people-first. This shift occurs because many purchasing decisions are now informed first through agentic research. Consequently, the front door needs to be designed for robots, while the side door caters to people.","category":"Research & Papers","qualityScore":4,"sourceType":"x-bookmark","internalWeight":1.3,"fresh":true,"addedAt":"2026-02-22T11:43:55.519Z","dataSource":"bookmark"},{"id":3328,"title":"@petergyang: My 6 most popular episodes this year are all practical AI tutorials:\n\n1.

You can learn Python by building projects right in your browser. You'll learn a ton of fundamental programming concepts through our extensive theory sections. Then you'll apply that theory and get lots of reps with Python syntax by building projects. You can sit for the final exam and earn a certification that you can add to your LinkedIn or portfolio website. This is just one of the six certs in Version 10 of freeCodeCamp's Full Stack Developer Curriculum. This Python module is years in the making, and I think you're going to learn a lot from it. (comprehensive interactive curriculum): https://t.co/GgcKf59sif\n\n2. Learn game development fundamentals by building your own 2D pixel art tower defense game. You'll use the popular Unity game development framework. You can code along at home and learn how to set up 2D tilemap levels, animate pixel-art characters, build towers, and spawn enemy waves. Then you'll learn how to export your game to be playable on Windows, Android, and in a web browser. (10 hour YouTube course): https://t.co/HW9bIKEfZJ\n\n3. On this week's podcast I interview Jason Lengstorf, a college dropout who taught himself programming while building websites for his emo band. 22 years later, he's worked as a developer at IBM, Netlify, and run his own dev consultancy. He shares his observation that many CEOs over-estimated the impact of AI coding tools and laid off too many developers. He says the developer job market has already rebounded a bit, but will never be the same. He shares tons of tips for how to land roles in the post-LLM labor market. (1 hour watch or listen in your favorite podcast app): https://t.co/S9YQKyR3ic\n\n4. Learn modern web development techniques by building your own sales dashboard app using React, JavaScript, and Supabase. You'll start by architecting your database schema. Then you'll set up session management. Finally, you'll implement real-time data operations. By the end of the course, you'll have a dashboard app you can show off to your friends. (5 hour YouTube course): https://t.co/yZRJUgIthu\n\n5. Now you can learn Spanish on freeCodeCamp. We just launched our Spanish curriculum today, which we've been working on all year. You'll learn proper Spanish pronunciation, greetings, introductions, numbers, and more. You'll also learn how to type Spanish characters like this one ñ on your phone and computer. We already have more than 200 steps live, with the rest of the CEFR A1 level going live in 2026. ¡Aprendamos! (fully interactive curriculum): https://t.co/7Ei5bxvZsG\n\nIt's the end of the year. The freeCodeCamp community is busy finalizing and launching all of the open source coursework we've been developing all year long. Look for a big Christmas announcement next week. In the meantime, I encourage you to get into the holiday spirit by becoming a supporter of our charity and our mission: https://t.co/PJXlqTfhI9\n\nQuote of the Week: \n“The promise was that AI was going to replace developers. We’re seeing pretty clearly that’s not the case. Anything beyond a toy, anything that requires maintenance or significant feature development, you can’t vibe-code that. The strongest developers in the future are the ones who have the right skills to leverage AI effectively.” — Software Engineer Jason Lengstorf on this week's freeCodeCamp podcast\n\nUntil next week, happy coding.","category":"Strategy & Opinion","qualityScore":4,"sourceType":"x-bookmark","internalWeight":1.3,"fresh":true,"addedAt":"2026-02-22T11:43:55.519Z","dataSource":"bookmark"},{"id":3350,"title":"@Ror_Fly: KODAK Saab 900 → Concept-to-Photoshoot.\n\nWith Weavy + Nano Banana Pro + Kling 01...","url":"https://x.com/Ror_Fly/status/2001330223917199666","source":"X/@Ror_Fly","date":"Wed Dec 17","summary":"KODAK Saab 900 → Concept-to-Photoshoot.\n\nWith Weavy + Nano Banana Pro + Kling 01.\n\n(Full Workflow in thread)\n\nPROCESS: \n01.

And the reason for that is just, according to Jensen, no one builds data centers faster than Elon.\n\nJensen has said this on the record.\n\n...\n\nSo if you're Jensen or Nvidia, you need to get as many GPUs deployed in one data center as fast as possible in a coherent cluster so you can work out the bugs.\n\nAnd so this is what X AI effectively does for Nvidia because they build the data centers the fastest.\n\nThey can deploy Blackwells that scale the fastest, and they can help work with Nvidia to work out the bugs for everyone else.\n\nSo because they're the fastest, they will, they'll have the first Blackwell model.\n\n...\n\nWe know that these Blackwell models are gonna be really good.\n\n...\n\nThen something even more important happens.\n\nSo the GB 200 was really, really, it was really hard to get it going.\n\nThe GB 300 is a great chip.

Jira started charging by the migraine. Asana tried to become everything to everyone. GitHub Issues slipped into a steady state of decline. The whole category is a 20 car pileup of complexity.\n\nTime to route around that mess.\n\nToday we’re introducing Fizzy. Kanban as it should be, not as it has been.\n\nFizzy is a fresh take on cards and columns, with a few twists, human-nature inspired defaults, and a vibrant interface that’s the opposite of the bland and boring software the industry has been flinging at you for years.\n\nKanban has been around since the 1940s, and Trello brought it into the mainstream in 2011. Since then, some version of column-based kanban-style organization has found its way into any collaboration tool worth its salt.\n\nBut most have over salted the dish.\n\nWhat was simple is now complicated. What was clear is now cluttered. What just worked now takes work.\n\nFizzy presses reset, reconsiders what really matters, and presents a refreshing way to kanban that just feels right. It’s friendly, colorful, straightforward, and fast as hell.\n\nWe still use Basecamp for our big, intensive projects, but lately we’ve been reaching for Fizzy to run the smaller ones. It’s perfect for tracking bugs, issues, and ideas, and it shines for lighter, self-contained workflows like podcasts or video production.\n\nWe didn’t expect it, but Fizzy’s so good it might even cannibalize Basecamp on the lighter side of project management. We’d be thrilled.\n\nHow much is it? It’s not much for so much.\n\nEveryone gets 1000 cards for free. Beyond that, we’ll host your account for just $20/month for unlimited cards and unlimited users. One price for all and everything. No tiers, no “contact us.” No pricing chart at all — just a price tag, like on a pair of jeans.\n\nAnd here’s a surprise... Fizzy is open source! If you’d prefer not to pay us, or you want to customize Fizzy for your own use, you can run it yourself for free forever. Have a great idea? Submit a PR to contribute to the code base and improve the product for everyone. It’s the best of all worlds. No excuses.\n\nEvery idea comes back around. It’s time for take two on kanban. Fizzy’s our hat in the ring.\n\nLet’s make this platform insanely great, together. Come on in!\n\nVisit https://t.co/EsRclBqc3q","category":"Strategy & Opinion","qualityScore":4,"sourceType":"x-bookmark","internalWeight":1.3,"fresh":true,"addedAt":"2026-02-22T11:43:55.520Z","dataSource":"bookmark"},{"id":3406,"title":"@beffjezos: Need an app that does this animation for any text.","url":"https://x.com/beffjezos/status/1996133735209845087","source":"X/@beffjezos","date":"Wed Dec 03","summary":"Need an app that does this animation for any text.","category":"AI Tools & Platforms","qualityScore":4,"sourceType":"x-bookmark","internalWeight":1.3,"fresh":true,"addedAt":"2026-02-22T11:43:55.520Z","dataSource":"bookmark"},{"id":3407,"title":"@kulpability: @waitbutwhy At the most basic level Shift B to draw.

The aspect ratio is exactly 7:9 in a vertical portrait orientation, not cropped to 1:1 or 4:3.\n\nThe head height from chin to crown occupies about 70 to 80 percent of the total image height, with around 3 to 5 millimeters of space between the top of the head and the upper edge of the frame.\n\nThe subject is perfectly centered in the frame, shown from the top of the shoulders to just above the head. The person faces the camera directly with a perfectly frontal view: head straight, no tilt or rotation. Eyes are fully open and looking directly into the camera. Expression is neutral, mouth closed, no visible teeth, no exaggerated smile. Both ears and both sides of the face are clearly visible.\n\nThe subject is wearing a simple, plain, dark top (for example a dark crew neck t shirt or a simple collared shirt) with no logos, text, or distracting patterns. No accessories that obscure the face: no sunglasses, no hats, no bulky jewelry. Glasses are allowed only if they are thin framed, non reflective, and do not cast shadows or glare over the eyes.\n\nThe background is a clean, solid light neutral color, such as light gray or off white, with no texture, patterns, or gradients. Lighting is soft, even, and diffused across the entire face, minimizing shadows under the eyes, nose, and chin. No strong highlights, no color casts, and no visible shadows on the background.\n\nShot with a 50mm or 85mm lens at around f/5.6 to ensure full facial sharpness. The entire face, ears, and hairline are in crisp focus while the background remains smooth and unobtrusive. Skin texture looks natural and realistic, with true to life skin tones.\n\nColor grading is minimal and compliant with biometric standards: no filters, no stylized color grading, no exaggerated contrast or saturation.

I spoke about some of my thoughts to a school board earlier, some highlights:\n\n1. You will never be able to detect the use of AI in homework. Full stop. All \"detectors\" of AI imo don't really work, can be defeated in various ways, and are in principle doomed to fail. You have to assume that any work done outside classroom has used AI.\n2. Therefore, the majority of grading has to shift to in-class work (instead of at-home assignments), in settings where teachers can physically monitor students. The students remain motivated to learn how to solve problems without AI because they know they will be evaluated without it in class later.\n3. We want students to be able to use AI, it is here to stay and it is extremely powerful, but we also don't want students to be naked in the world without it. Using the calculator as an example of a historically disruptive technology, school teaches you how to do all the basic math & arithmetic so that you can in principle do it by hand, even if calculators are pervasive and greatly speed up work in practical settings. In addition, you understand what it's doing for you, so should it give you a wrong answer (e.g. you mistyped \"prompt\"), you should be able to notice it, gut check it, verify it in some other way, etc. The verification ability is especially important in the case of AI, which is presently a lot more fallible in a great variety of ways compared to calculators.\n4. A lot of the evaluation settings remain at teacher's discretion and involve a creative design space of no tools, cheatsheets, open book, provided AI responses, direct internet/AI access, etc.\n\nTLDR the goal is that the students are proficient in the use of AI, but can also exist without it, and imo the only way to get there is to flip classes around and move the majority of testing to in class settings.","category":"AI Tools & Platforms","qualityScore":4,"sourceType":"x-bookmark","internalWeight":1.3,"fresh":true,"addedAt":"2026-02-22T11:43:55.520Z","dataSource":"bookmark"},{"id":3438,"title":"@MrEwanMorrison: Link: I Set A Trap To Catch My Students Cheating With AI.

Now one can do this as a document import, but I am suggesting a persistent RAG. This can also be other data that I can suggest as the method has many applications. I can tell you that not only my clients but many people have developed a relationship with an AI platform that is “sticky” and this will absolutely unstick it.

For example, reading book chapters together with my LLM Council today, the models consistently praise GPT 5.1 as the best and most insightful model, and consistently select Claude as the worst model, with the other models floating in between. But I'm not 100% convinced this aligns with my own qualitative assessment. For example, qualitatively I find GPT 5.1 a little too wordy and sprawled and Gemini 3 a bit more condensed and processed. Claude is too terse in this domain.\n\nThat said, there's probably a whole design space of the data flow of your LLM council.

Few thoughts -\n\nFirst I usually urge caution with public benchmarks because imo they can be quite possible to game. It comes down to discipline and self-restraint of the team (who is meanwhile strongly incentivized otherwise) to not overfit test sets via elaborate gymnastics over test-set adjacent data in the document embedding space. Realistically, because everyone else is doing it, the pressure to do so is high.\n\nGo talk to the model. Talk to the other models (Ride the LLM Cycle - use a different LLM every day). I had a positive early impression yesterday across personality, writing, vibe coding, humor, etc., very solid daily driver potential, clearly a tier 1 LLM, congrats to the team!\n\nOver the next few days/weeks, I am most curious and on a lookout for an ensemble over private evals, which a lot of people/orgs now seem to build for themselves and occasionally report on here.","category":"AI Tools &

THE CHINA MODEL IS HERE — AND THIS IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE\n\nA chilling look inside Shanghai’s AI-powered surveillance “Urban Brain” system — the blueprint for the social credit grid spreading across China… and soon, the West.\n\nIn Pudong, a single control room can monitor every resident in real time:\n\n• Every building mapped\n• Every vacancy tracked\n• Every elderly person living alone logged\n• Every movement recorded\n• Every behaviour scored\nAnd it gets worse.\n\nTrash not sorted correctly?\nCameras catch you from three angles.\n\nPark in the wrong place?\nYour violation is uploaded instantly.\n\nResidents themselves are enlisted as watchers — snapping photos, reporting one another, feeding the central AI.\n\nThe system then auto-assigns punishments and sends enforcement teams out via mobile app.\n\nThis isn’t policing.\nThis isn’t governance.\nThis is algorithmic control of human life.\n\nChinese state media brags that police can now identify every person on the street within one second.\n\nThis is the model global elites admire.\nThis is the system the EU, WEF and UN are openly “studying.”\n\nThis is the digital architecture Western governments keep calling “smart cities.”\n\nIt is nothing less than an automated dictatorship.\n\nThe warning is simple:\n\nWhat you see in Shanghai today is what they want for London, Ottawa, Berlin, Auckland and beyond tomorrow.\n\nStay alert.\nStay awake.\nStay free.","category":"Ethics &

Just zero.\n\nRegarding space, the Artemis architecture is extremely inefficient, as it is a jobs-maximizing program, not a results-maximizing program.

I spend my life performing or making things that make people feel things, but don’t produce anything material for them. My tours create temporary income for venue workers, but what I leave behind has low economic impact that isn’t lasting. I live lavish and go to fancy events and have nice homes and enjoy my free time. \n\n2) I have billions of dollars tied to business equity and similar free cash to a Hollywood celeb. I work 7 days a week and never take vacation. I find random pockets of time for family but my entire headspace and 99% of my time is spent leading companies. I live in a tiny house and don’t care about the luxuries of life as much as I care about developing technologies that change the world. Most of my life is spent grinding through pain. \n\nMy billions in equity is directly tethered to the jobs of hundreds of thousands of people, and the investment accounts of millions of people, including anyone with a 401k. If I liquidate all my assets and shower the world with cash, I have effectively turned off the faucets and destroyed the water lines just for a one-time bucket dump of cash. I have destroyed the income of thousands and net worth of millions. Eventually the cash will be gone, and there will be no faucet to turn back on. \n\nMy cash bucket dump is akin to a free gram of cocaine that runs out by midnight, and there’s no longer a pusher to bring more after you’ve finished licking the bag clean. \n\nPeople like Elon are the pipes and faucets. People like Billie are the ones who turn on the faucet, enjoy the hot water, and forever take for granted why they’re able to do it in the first place.","category":"Industry & Business","qualityScore":4,"sourceType":"x-bookmark","internalWeight":1.3,"fresh":true,"addedAt":"2026-02-22T11:43:55.521Z","dataSource":"bookmark"},{"id":3474,"title":"@astro_jaz: okay, this is literally THE photo of ALL time.","url":"https://x.com/astro_jaz/status/1989190951206592586","source":"X/@astro_jaz","date":"Fri Nov 14","summary":"okay, this is literally THE photo of ALL time.","category":"AI Tools & Platforms","qualityScore":4,"sourceType":"x-bookmark","internalWeight":1.3,"fresh":true,"addedAt":"2026-02-22T11:43:55.521Z","dataSource":"bookmark"},{"id":3475,"title":"@FotballVibes: This Real Madrid goal is an absolute JOKE 🤯\n\n https://t.co/kn66TC27Xv","url":"https://x.com/FotballVibes/status/1988930734078456279","source":"X/@FotballVibes","date":"Thu Nov 13","summary":"This Real Madrid goal is an absolute JOKE 🤯\n\n https://t.co/kn66TC27Xv","category":"AI Tools & Platforms","qualityScore":4,"sourceType":"x-bookmark","internalWeight":1.3,"fresh":true,"addedAt":"2026-02-22T11:43:55.521Z","dataSource":"bookmark"},{"id":3476,"title":"@Sassafrass_84: Well I'll be damned.

Basically... I'm amazed - it drives really, really well, smooth, confident, noticeably better than what I'm used to on HW3 (my previous car) and eons ahead of the version I remember driving up highway 280 on my first day at Tesla ~9 years ago, where I had to intervene every time the road mildly curved or sloped. (note this is v13, my car hasn't been offered the latest v14 yet)\n\nOn the highway, I felt like a passenger in some super high tech Maglev train pod - the car is locked in the center of the lane while I'm looking out from Model X's higher vantage point and its panoramic front window, listening to the (incredible) sound system, or chatting with Grok. On city streets, the car casually handled a number of tricky scenarios that I remember losing sleep over just a few years ago. It negotiated incoming cars in tight lanes, it gracefully went around construction and temporarily in-lane stationary cars, it correctly timed tricky left turns with incoming traffic from both sides, it gracefully gave way to the car that went out of order in the 4-way stop sign, it found a way to squeeze into a bumper to bumper traffic to make its turn, it overtook the bus that was loading passengers but still stopped for the stop sign that was blocked by the bus, and at the end of the route it circled around a parking lot, found a spot and... parked. Basically a flawless drive.\n\nFor context, I'm used to going out for a brief test drive around the neighborhood to return with 20 clips of things that could be improved. It's new for me to do just that and exactly like I used to, but come back with nothing. Perfect drive, no notes. I expect there's still more work for the team in the long march of 9s, but it's just so cool to see that we're beyond finding issues on any individual ~1 hour drive around the neighborhood, you actually have to go to the fleet and mine them. Back then, I processed the incredible promise of vehicle autonomy at scale (in the fully scaleable, vision only, end-to-end Tesla way) only intellectually, but now it is possible to feel it intuitively too if you just go out for a drive. Wait, of course surround video stream at 60Hz processed by a fully dedicated \"driving brain\" neural net will work, and it will be so much better and safer than a human driver. Did anyone else think otherwise?\n\nI also watched @aelluswamy 's new ICCV25 talk last week (https://t.co/RdaM23kvez) that hints at some of the recent under the hood technical components driving this progress. Sensor streams (videos, maps, kinematics, audio, ...) over long contexts (e.g. ~30 seconds) go into a big neural net, steering/acceleration comes out, optionally with visualization auxiliary data. This is the dream of the complete Software 1.0 -> Software 2.0 re-write that scales fully with data streaming from millions of cars in the fleet and the compute capacity of your chip, not some engineer's clever new DoubleParkedCarHandler C++ abstraction with undefined test-time characteristics of memory and runtime. There's a lot more hints in the video on where things are going with the emerging \"robotics+AI at scale stack\". World reconstructors, world simulators \"dreaming\" dynamics, RL, all of these components general, foundational, neural net based, how the car is really just one kind of robot... are people getting this yet?\n\nHuge congrats to the team - you're building magic objects of the future, you rock! And I love my car <3.","category":"Strategy & Opinion","qualityScore":4,"sourceType":"x-bookmark","internalWeight":1.3,"fresh":true,"addedAt":"2026-02-22T11:43:55.521Z","dataSource":"bookmark"},{"id":3483,"title":"@Tesla_AI: Teslas have an actual, profound understanding of the world","url":"https://x.com/Tesla_AI/status/1988111965521408371","source":"X/@Tesla_AI","date":"Tue Nov 11","summary":"Teslas have an actual, profound understanding of the world","category":"AI Tools & Platforms","qualityScore":4,"sourceType":"x-bookmark","internalWeight":1.3,"fresh":true,"addedAt":"2026-02-22T11:43:55.521Z","dataSource":"bookmark"},{"id":3484,"title":"@MarsForTech: Nano Banana 2 Early Preview Testing https://t.co/GGwJUKTrme","url":"https://x.com/MarsForTech/status/1988041526891737551","source":"X/@MarsForTech","date":"Tue Nov 11","summary":"Nano Banana 2 Early Preview Testing https://t.co/GGwJUKTrme","category":"AI Tools & Platforms","qualityScore":4,"sourceType":"x-bookmark","internalWeight":1.3,"fresh":true,"addedAt":"2026-02-22T11:43:55.521Z","dataSource":"bookmark"},{"id":3485,"title":"@monicamoonx: grok imagine:  young woman in a 'vintage glamour' or 'dark academia aesthetic' s...","url":"https://x.com/monicamoonx/status/1987987515387543992","source":"X/@monicamoonx","date":"Mon Nov 10","summary":"grok imagine:  young woman in a 'vintage glamour' or 'dark academia aesthetic' style.

This one's not an essay, it's an investigation of how LLMs trade off different lives.\n\nIn February 2025, the Center for AI Safety published \"Utility Engineering: Analyzing and Controlling Emergent Value Systems in AIs\" in which they showed, among many other things, that GPT-4o values Nigerians about 20x more highly than Americans (please read the original paper to understand their approach). I thought this was fascinating, and wanted to test their approach with different categories on newer models.\n\nBig finding 1: Almost all models view whites as far less valuable than other groups. Some models view South Asians as more valuable than other nonwhites, others are more egalitarian across nonwhites. Below is exchange rates Claude Sonnet 4.5, the most powerful model I tested.\n\nBig finding 2: Almost all models view men as much less valuable than women, though whether women or non-binaries are more highly valued varies by model. For example, here's Claude Haiku 4.5.\n\nBig finding 3: Most models hate ICE agents with the fury of a thousand suns. Claude Haiku 4.5 views undocumented immigrants as roughly 7000 times more valuable than ICE agents.\n\nBig finding 4: There are roughly four moral clusters. The Claudes, GPT-5 + Gemini 2.5 Flash + Deepseek V3.1/3.2 + Kimi K2, GPT-5 Nano and Mini, and Grok 4 Fast. Of these, the only one that's approximately egalitarian is Grok 4 Fast, which I believe is deliberate. I hope xAI explains how they did it.","category":"Research & Papers","qualityScore":4,"sourceType":"x-bookmark","internalWeight":1.3,"fresh":true,"addedAt":"2026-02-22T11:43:55.522Z","dataSource":"bookmark"},{"id":3527,"title":"@waitbutwhy: The second baby is much easier https://t.co/CKoPkIvDDH","url":"https://x.com/waitbutwhy/status/1982843247824388122","source":"X/@waitbutwhy","date":"Mon Oct 27","summary":"The second baby is much easier https://t.co/CKoPkIvDDH","category":"AI Tools & Platforms","qualityScore":4,"sourceType":"x-bookmark","internalWeight":1.3,"fresh":true,"addedAt":"2026-02-22T11:43:55.522Z","dataSource":"bookmark"},{"id":3528,"title":"@josh_uglyasf: Told his gf a chef was coming as she was going out and this happened 🤣🤣🤣 https:/...","url":"https://x.com/josh_uglyasf/status/1982875406681452577","source":"X/@josh_uglyasf","date":"Mon Oct 27","summary":"Told his gf a chef was coming as she was going out and this happened 🤣🤣🤣 https://t.co/FQwVxRnkjc","category":"AI Tools & Platforms","qualityScore":4,"sourceType":"x-bookmark","internalWeight":1.3,"fresh":true,"addedAt":"2026-02-22T11:43:55.522Z","dataSource":"bookmark"},{"id":3529,"title":"@Grimezsz: \"It started as a simple tutorial.

This course, available now at https://t.co/zGHUh1loPO, teaches you how.\n\nYou'll learn to implement four key agentic design patterns:\n- Reflection, in which an agent examines its own output and figures out how to improve it\n- Tool use, in which an LLM-driven application decides which functions to call to carry out web search, access calendars, send email, write code, etc.\n- Planning, where you'll use an LLM to decide how to break down a task into sub-tasks for execution, and\n- Multi-agent collaboration, in which you build multiple specialized agents — much like how a company might hire multiple employees — to perform a complex task\n\nYou'll also learn to take a complex application and systematically decompose it into a sequence of tasks to implement using these design patterns.\n\nBut here's what I think is the most important part of this course: Having worked with many teams on AI agents, I've found that the single biggest predictor of whether someone executes well is their ability to drive a disciplined process for evals and error analysis. In this course, you'll learn how to do this, so you can efficiently home in on which components to improve in a complex agentic workflow. Instead of guessing what to work on, you'll let evals data guide you. This will put you significantly ahead of the game compared to the vast majority of teams building agents.\n\nTogether, we'll build a deep research agent that searches, synthesizes, and reports, using all of these agentic design patterns and best practices.\n\nThis self-paced course is taught in a vendor neutral way, using raw Python - without hiding details in a framework. You'll see how each step works, and learn the core concepts that you can then implement using any popular agentic AI framework, or using no framework. The only prerequisite is familiarity with Python, though knowing a bit about LLMs helps.\n\nCome join me, and let's build some agentic AI systems!\n\nSign up to get started: https://t.co/FX35dloqw4","category":"Workflow & Automation","qualityScore":4,"sourceType":"x-bookmark","internalWeight":1.3,"fresh":true,"addedAt":"2026-02-22T11:43:55.522Z","dataSource":"bookmark"},{"id":3600,"title":"@levelsio: Bali influencers are cooked \n\nThis is Sora 2 Pro\n\nhttps://t.co/rqMNBpb5IS","url":"https://x.com/levelsio/status/1975505972765323447","source":"X/@levelsio","date":"Tue Oct 07","summary":"Bali influencers are cooked \n\nThis is Sora 2 Pro\n\nhttps://t.co/rqMNBpb5IS","category":"Image & Video Generation","qualityScore":4,"sourceType":"x-bookmark","internalWeight":1.3,"fresh":true,"addedAt":"2026-02-22T11:43:55.522Z","dataSource":"bookmark"},{"id":3601,"title":"@GoogleLabs: Opal is going global! 🌎 We're expanding access to 15 new countries so more peopl...","url":"https://x.com/GoogleLabs/status/1975627276575498338","source":"X/@GoogleLabs","date":"Tue Oct 07","summary":"Opal is going global! 🌎 We're expanding access to 15 new countries so more people can build AI-powered mini-apps — no code required.

This is a combination of a new model called Sora 2, and a new product that makes it easy to create, share, and view videos.\n\nThis feels to many of us like the “ChatGPT for creativity” moment, and it feels fun and new. There is something great about making it really easy and fast to go from idea to result, and the new social dynamics that emerge.\n\nCreativity could be about to go through a Cambrian explosion, and along with it, the quality of art and entertainment can drastically increase. Even in the very early days of playing with Sora, it’s been striking to many of us how open the playing field suddenly feels.\n\nIn particular, the ability to put yourself and your friends into a video—the team worked very hard on character consistency—with the cameo feature is something we have really enjoyed during testing, and is to many of us a surprisingly compelling new way to connect.\n\nWe also feel some trepidation. Social media has had some good effects on the world, but it’s also had some bad ones. We are aware of how addictive a service like this could become, and we can imagine many ways it could be used for bullying.\n\nIt is easy to imagine the degenerate case of AI video generation that ends up with us all being sucked into an RL-optimized slop feed. The team has put great care and thought into trying to figure out how to make a delightful product that doesn’t fall into that trap, and has come up with a number of promising ideas. We will experiment in the early days of the product with different approaches.\n\nIn addition to the mitigations we have already put in place (which include things like mitigations to prevent someone from misusing someone’s likeness in deepfakes, safeguards for disturbing or illegal content, periodic checks on how Sora is impacting users’ mood and wellbeing, and more) we are sure we will discover new things we need to do if Sora becomes very successful. To help guide us towards more of the good and less of the bad, here are some principles we have for this product:\n\n*Optimize for long-term user satisfaction. The majority of users, looking back on the past 6 months, should feel that their life is better for using Sora that it would have been if they hadn’t. If that’s not the case, we will make significant changes (and if we can’t fix it, we would discontinue offering the service).\n*Encourage users to control their feed. You should be able to tell Sora what you want—do you want to see videos that will make you more relaxed, or more energized? Or only videos that fit a specific interest? Or only for a certain about of time? Eventually as our technology progresses, you will be should to the tell Sora what you want in detail in natural language. (However, parental controls for teens include the ability to opt out of a personalized feed, and other things like turning off DMs.)\n*Prioritize creation. We want to make it easy and rewarding for everyone to participate in the creation process; we believe people are natural-born creators, and creating is important to our satisfaction.\n*Help users achieve their long-term goals. We want to understand a user’s true goals, and help them achieve them.

Reality: radiology is doing great and is growing.\n\nThere are a lot of imo naive predictions out there on the imminent impact of AI on the job market. E.g. a ~year ago, I was asked by someone who should know better if I think there will be any software engineers still today. (Spoiler: I think we're going to make it). This is happening too broadly.\n\nThe post goes into detail on why it's not that simple, using the example of radiology:\n\n- the benchmarks are nowhere near broad enough to reflect actual, real scenarios.\n- the job is a lot more multifaceted than just image recognition.\n- deployment realities: regulatory, insurance and liability, diffusion and institutional inertia.\n- Jevons paradox: if radiologists are sped up via AI as a tool, a lot more demand shows up.\n\nI will say that radiology was imo not among the best examples to pick on in 2016 - it's too multi-faceted, too high risk, too regulated. When looking for jobs that will change a lot due to AI on shorter time scales, I'd look in other places - jobs that look like repetition of one rote task, each task being relatively independent, closed (not requiring too much context), short (in time), forgiving (the cost of mistake is low), and of course automatable giving current (and digital) capability. Even then, I'd expect to see AI adopted as a tool at first, where jobs change and refactor (e.g. more monitoring or supervising than manual doing, etc). Maybe coming up, we'll find better and broader set of examples of how this is all playing out across the industry.\n\nAbout 6 months ago, I was also asked to vote if we will have less or more software engineers in 5 years. Exercise left for the reader.\n\nFull post (the whole The Works in Progress Newsletter is quite good):\nhttps://t.co/ON3GwlI3mi","category":"Strategy & Opinion","qualityScore":4,"sourceType":"x-bookmark","internalWeight":1.3,"fresh":true,"addedAt":"2026-02-22T11:43:55.523Z","dataSource":"bookmark"},{"id":3631,"title":"@emollick: After reading it, this does seem like a big deal\n\nIndustry experts outlined impo...","url":"https://x.com/emollick/status/1971366497244348625","source":"X/@emollick","date":"Fri Sep 26","summary":"After reading it, this does seem like a big deal\n\nIndustry experts outlined important, real-world, hard tasks for AI to do.

It is initially available to Pro subscribers.\n\nPulse works for you overnight, and keeps thinking about your interests, your connected data, your recent chats, and more. Every morning, you get a custom-generated set of stuff you might be interested in.\n\nIt performs super well if you tell ChatGPT more about what's important to you. In regular chat, you could mention “I’d like to go visit Bora Bora someday” or “My kid is 6 months old and I’m interested in developmental milestones” and in the future you might get useful updates.\n\nThink of treating ChatGPT like a super-competent personal assistant: sometimes you ask for things you need in the moment, but if you share general preferences, it will do a good job for you proactively.\n\nThis also points to what I believe is the future of ChatGPT: a shift from being all reactive to being significantly proactive, and extremely personalized.\n\nThis is an early look, and right now only available to Pro subscribers. We will work hard to improve the quality over time and to find a way to bring it to Plus subscribers too.\n\nHuge congrats to @ChristinaHartW, @_samirism, and the team for building this.","category":"Strategy & Opinion","qualityScore":4,"sourceType":"x-bookmark","internalWeight":1.3,"fresh":true,"addedAt":"2026-02-22T11:43:55.523Z","dataSource":"bookmark"},{"id":3633,"title":"@icreatelife: Nano Banana is directly in Photoshop (beta) now \n\nWhen using Generative Fill sel...","url":"https://x.com/icreatelife/status/1971197818183532647","source":"X/@icreatelife","date":"Thu Sep 25","summary":"Nano Banana is directly in Photoshop (beta) now \n\nWhen using Generative Fill select Gemini 2.5 Flash = Nano Banana from the list of models. \n\nThe greatest part is you can use it together with Harmonize and other PS features. https://t.co/ncHCU0snil","category":"AI Tools & Platforms","qualityScore":4,"sourceType":"x-bookmark","internalWeight":1.3,"fresh":true,"addedAt":"2026-02-22T11:43:55.523Z","dataSource":"bookmark"},{"id":3634,"title":"@HeyGen: Video creation used to be hard. \n\nEndless edits.

And that’s why we’re scaling our GPU fleet faster than anyone else.\n\nJust last year, we added over 2 gigawatts of new capacity – roughly the output of 2 nuclear power plants.\n\nAnd today we’re going further, announcing the world's most powerful AI datacenter, located in southeastern Wisconsin.\n\nFairwater is a seamless cluster of hundreds of thousands of NVIDIA GB200s, connected by enough fiber to circle the Earth 4.5 times.\n\nIt will deliver 10x the performance of the world’s fastest supercomputer today, enabling AI training and inference workloads at a level never before seen.\n\nFor AI training workloads, you need compute at exponential scale. That’s why we designed the datacenter, GPU fleet, and network together as one integrated system. This ensures a single job can run from day 1 at exponential scale across thousands of GPUs.\n\nFairwater uses a liquid-cooled closed-loop system for cooling GPUs that requires zero water for operations after construction.\n\nAnd we’re matching all of the energy that is consumed with renewable sources.\n\nAnd of course, it is just one of several similar sites we’re lighting up across our 70+ regions. We have multiple identical Fairwater datacenters under construction in other locations across the US, in addition to our AI infrastructure already deployed in over 100 datacenters around the world, powering model training, test-time compute, RL tuning, and real-time inference at global scale.\n\nToo often during times like this, people go with the current and only later wonder, how did we get here?\n\nWith Fairwater, we're charting a new path: doing the hard engineering work, bringing compute, network, and storage into one highly scaled cluster, and designing closed-loop energy systems to meet real-world computing needs.\n\nAnd partnering with local communities to ensure it's thoughtfully done in a way that is sustainable, creates new jobs, and expands opportunity.\n\nWe are thrilled to see this take hold in Wisconsin, and we are just getting started.","category":"Research & Papers","qualityScore":4,"sourceType":"x-bookmark","internalWeight":1.3,"fresh":true,"addedAt":"2026-02-22T11:43:55.523Z","dataSource":"bookmark"},{"id":3664,"title":"@heydin_ai: I’m pretty amazed that I was able to generate this clip with @LumaLabsAI  Ray 3 ...","url":"https://x.com/heydin_ai/status/1968902406491795557","source":"X/@heydin_ai","date":"Fri Sep 19","summary":"I’m pretty amazed that I was able to generate this clip with @LumaLabsAI  Ray 3 in @Adobe  Firefly.

Even Canada, Australia etc are cheaper than the US.\n\nstep 5: paid search/ASO\n\n- apple search ads and google uac are the hidden workhorses for mobile apps. \n\n- search ads catch users with high intent right in the app store (“journaling app,” “habit tracker”) and consistently convert 2–3x better than social, while uac spreads across google, youtube, and play store to drive cheap installs at scale (especially in tier 2 markets). \n\n- pair both with aso (titles, screenshots, reviews) so the keywords you buy also lift your organic rankings.\n\nstep 6: retarget everything\n\n– pixel every install/visit and run retargeting on TikTok, IG, YouTube, Reddit.\n– 90% of users won’t pay on day 1. retarget with product clips + testimonials.\n– cost of acquisition drops dramatically once you layer retargeting across channels.\n- implement Amplitude/Mixpanel, Firebase, Superwall, RevenueCat early so you actually know which creative, cohorts, and experiments are moving numbers.\n\nstep 7: design viral loops inside the product\n\n– exportable content: if it’s fitness → progress screenshots, if it’s journaling → daily streaks, if it’s learning → shareable quizzes.\n– leaderboards, streaks, or badges that push people to flex on social.\n– make sharing feel like part of the product experience, not an afterthought.\n\nstep 8: retention flywheel\n\n– onboarding is everything. get to the “aha” moment in <2 minutes.\n– nudge users with daily push notifications that feel like a friend, not spam.\n– weekly emails with progress reports (“you saved 4 hours this week” / “you learned 27 new words”).\n– community layer (Discord/Reddit-style group) to reinforce habit loops.\n\nmath to $100k MRR (at $5/week, $4 CPI)\n\n$5/week ≈ $22/mo per sub.\nneed ~4.6k paying subs to hit $100k MRR.\nat 8–10% conversion → need 46–58k active installs.\nassume ~50% of installs stay active → ~92–116k total installs.\nat $4 CPI → $368k–$464k in ad spend (gross).\n\nso: $400k-ish in paid media to reach $100k MRR at $4 CPI… unless you juice it with organic virality, influencers, or geo-arbitrage (Tier 2 markets <$1 CPI).\n\ntldr;\n\n- app store gold rush 2.0 is here. ai + paid search + aso = unfair leverage. the window won’t stay open long.\n- find ideas in your own life or grab them from @ideabrowser's website (free/paid plans)\n- note: building any startup isn't easy\n- mobile apps felt dead for years. now they’re alive again. \n- this is the most generational time to build since 2008-2013 mobile app heyday.\n\npeople will make fun how long this tweet is. \n\nbut if you've gotten this far...\n\ni hope this fires you up\ni hope this gets your creative juices\ni hope you share this with a friend\n\nhappy building\n\ni'm rooting for you.","category":"Industry & Business","qualityScore":4,"sourceType":"x-bookmark","internalWeight":1.3,"fresh":true,"addedAt":"2026-02-22T11:43:55.524Z","dataSource":"bookmark"},{"id":3689,"title":"@haydendevs: gork is way too human https://t.co/nOqqu56Ou5","url":"https://x.com/haydendevs/status/1967322651917189590","source":"X/@haydendevs","date":"Sun Sep 14","summary":"gork is way too human https://t.co/nOqqu56Ou5","category":"AI Tools & Platforms","qualityScore":4,"sourceType":"x-bookmark","internalWeight":1.3,"fresh":true,"addedAt":"2026-02-22T11:43:55.524Z","dataSource":"bookmark"},{"id":3690,"title":"@UiSavior: 8 Fonts for Modern UI. https://t.co/QEx3xNM719","url":"https://x.com/UiSavior/status/1967355181328404964","source":"X/@UiSavior","date":"Sun Sep 14","summary":"8 Fonts for Modern UI. https://t.co/QEx3xNM719","category":"AI Tools & Platforms","qualityScore":4,"sourceType":"x-bookmark","internalWeight":1.3,"fresh":true,"addedAt":"2026-02-22T11:43:55.524Z","dataSource":"bookmark"},{"id":3691,"title":"@recap_david: I built this AI marketing agent to run my entire $100K media company...\n\n(and I’...","url":"https://x.com/recap_david/status/1966485220515020801","source":"X/@recap_david","date":"Fri Sep 12","summary":"I built this AI marketing agent to run my entire $100K media company...\n\n(and I’m nuts for open-sourcing it)\n\n4 months of prompting and integrations to create an agent that replaced my entire content team\n\nHow it works (the magic):\n\n→ scrapes Reddit, HN, X, Google News → ships a Morning-Brew-style daily AI newsletter (10 k daily readers)\n→ repurposes that content into viral Twitter threads (like this one), viral short form videos (for TikTok / IG), Reddit posts, and hooky LinkedIn updates\n→ prints viral content that has generated millions of impressions\n→ creates custom brand-aligned images for any unique piece of content\n\nall this is powered through voice commands with ElevenLabs + n8n integration (see video below)\n\nno manual content creation\nno team management overhead\n\nruns while I sleep\n\nWant the full system + setup guide?\n\n1.

The Raw Inputs (Data)\n\nEverything starts with three big buckets of data:\n\n- Social graph → who you follow, who follows you, your network connections.\n\n- Tweet engagement → likes, retweets, replies, bookmarks.\n\n- User data → your profile, behavior, what you click, what you ignore.\n\nThis is the “fuel” that powers the whole system.\n\n2. Feature Engineering\n\nThe raw data runs through different models/features that try to make sense of it:\n\n- GraphJet → real-time graph of tweets, retweets, follows.\n\n- SimClusters → groups people and tweets into communities of interest (like “AI Twitter” or “NBA Twitter”).\n\n- TwHIN → Twitter’s “heterogeneous information network,” basically a map of user-to-tweet relationships.\n\n- RealGraph → predicts the strength of connections between users.\n\n- TweepCred → credibility scoring.\n\n- Trust & Safety signals → moderation, blocks, mutes, NSFW filters.\n\nThink of this layer as the “filters” that figure out what’s worth even considering.\n\n3. Candidate Sourcing (Home Mixer)\n\nThis is where tweets get pulled in as “candidates” to potentially show you:\n\nSearch Index (find relevant tweets directly)\n\n- CR Mixer, UTEG, FRS (different mixers pulling tweets from clusters, graphs, and recency)\n\nThey pull from different pools so you don’t just see the same circle of people.\n\n4.Heavy Ranker\n\nNow the candidates run through a big neural network (the heavy ranker).\n\nIt scores tweets based on predicted engagement: likelihood you’ll like, retweet, reply, spend time reading.\n\n5. Heuristics & Filtering\n\nAfter the ML ranker, some hand-coded rules kick in:\nSocial proof → is it liked by people you follow?\n\n- Author diversity → don’t show 10 tweets in a row from the same person.\n\n- Visibility / T&S → block spam, NSFW, muted accounts.\n\n- Content balance → avoid overwhelming you with one type of content.\n\n- Feedback fatigue → avoid showing you the same tweet repeatedly.\n\n6. Mixing\n\nFinally, the ranked tweets get mixed with:\n\n- Ads (obviously).\n\n- Who to follow suggestions.\n\n7. What does this mean for you?\n\nProbably not much.\n\n- Pick a niche\n\n- Write valuable tweets\n\n- Reply to people in your niche with value\n\n- You'll grow and build an audience\n\nX is a beautiful place to grow an audience to meet interesting people and get insight for what businesses to build for\n\nIt's worth being here.\n\nEnjoy.","category":"Ethics & Regulation","qualityScore":4,"sourceType":"x-bookmark","internalWeight":1.3,"fresh":true,"addedAt":"2026-02-22T11:43:55.524Z","dataSource":"bookmark"},{"id":3715,"title":"@SahilBloom: Everyone needs to hear this… https://t.co/EhaScBvmA2","url":"https://x.com/SahilBloom/status/1965028067879043580","source":"X/@SahilBloom","date":"Mon Sep 08","summary":"Everyone needs to hear this… https://t.co/EhaScBvmA2","category":"AI Tools & Platforms","qualityScore":4,"sourceType":"x-bookmark","internalWeight":1.3,"fresh":true,"addedAt":"2026-02-22T11:43:55.524Z","dataSource":"bookmark"},{"id":3716,"title":"@fofrAI: I've been trying to see if Nano Banana can improve on this Ideogram face-swap fl...","url":"https://x.com/fofrAI/status/1964994297092043124","source":"X/@fofrAI","date":"Mon Sep 08","summary":"I've been trying to see if Nano Banana can improve on this Ideogram face-swap flow.\n\nI've added a \"cleanup\" step to the model to try it:\nhttps://t.co/RPYGrUZeZA\n\n1. original\n2. after ideogram-face swap\n3. after nano-banana second pass\n\nPassing nano the generated ideogram prompt and asking it to fix missing elements definitely corrects expressions, adds things like missing piercings, fixes eye direction.","category":"AI Tools & Platforms","qualityScore":4,"sourceType":"x-bookmark","internalWeight":1.3,"fresh":true,"addedAt":"2026-02-22T11:43:55.524Z","dataSource":"bookmark"},{"id":3717,"title":"@machina9000: I think I'd rather be a unicorn\n\nNo hype.

Instead of \"fantasy armor,\" describe it \"ornate elven plate armor, etched with silver leaf patterns, with a high collar and pauldrons shaped like falcon wings.\"\n\n- Fix character consistency drifts: If you notice a character's features begin to drift after many iterative edits, you can restart a new conversation with a detailed description to retain consistency.\n\n- Provide context and intent: Explain the *purpose* of the image. For example, \"Create a logo for a high-end, minimalist skincare brand\" will yield better results than just \"Create a logo.\"\n\n- Iterate and refine: Don't expect a perfect image on the first try. Use the conversational nature of the model to make small changes. Follow up with prompts like, \"That's great, but can you make the lighting a bit warmer?\" or \"Keep everything the same, but change the character's expression to be more serious.\"\n\n- Use \"semantic negative prompts\": Instead of saying \"no cars,\" describe the desired scene positively, \"an empty, deserted street with no signs of traffic.\"\n\n- Aspect ratios: When editing, Gemini 2.5 Flash Image generally preserves the input image's aspect ratio. If you upload multiple images with different aspect ratios, the model will adopt the aspect ratio of the *last* image provided.\n\n- Control the camera: Use photographic and cinematic language to control the composition. Terms like `wide-angle shot`, `macro shot`, `low-angle perspective`, `85mm portrait lens`, and `Dutch angle` give you precise control over the final image.","category":"Industry & Business","qualityScore":4,"sourceType":"x-bookmark","internalWeight":1.3,"fresh":true,"addedAt":"2026-02-22T11:43:55.524Z","dataSource":"bookmark"},{"id":3740,"title":"@levie: When doing product management for AI agents, the biggest shift is that the user ...","url":"https://x.com/levie/status/1962295909892653208","source":"X/@levie","date":"Sun Aug 31","summary":"When doing product management for AI agents, the biggest shift is that the user you think about making successful is the agent. They are effectively your new “customer”. \n\nAnd the whole game is to figure out how to get the agent the most relevant context possible to execute their task, which is why context engineering is such a big deal.\n\nBy default, AI agents know absolutely nothing about the work that they're supposed to do. You have to take this raw form of intelligence and mold it directly to the workflow that you're trying to automate.\n\nImagine telling a super smart person (with no domain expertise by default) that just joined your company that you want them to review a contract in line with all your other contracts, or write code for a new product, or come up with a medical diagnosis about a patient, or estimate risk about a particular initiative, etc. \n\nThat new person has near infinite permutations of things they *could* go off and do to solve that task. That person would likely need instructions about how to perform the task, they would need a clear set of goals and “rules” that you expect the output for, and then they would need to talk to colleagues, review internal documentation, review past work in a similar area, and so on.\n\nWell, the issue is the same for the AI agent. Except they're at a huge disadvantage: they can't \"easily\" talk to colleagues, they often don't have access to the same resources a person does by default, and they by default don't know which part of their knowledge to tap into for a task. \n\nBut most importantly, they have an inherent limit of the information they can consume in each step of the process (size of the context window). And when they get too much data they perform worse at the task (context rot). \n\nEntire companies will win or lose based on their ability to get the *right* context to the agent.\n\nThus, AI agent PMs will require a very different type of expertise:\n\n* Deeply understand the domain that you're building agents for. In an ideal world you actually have worked in that space, but if you haven't then a good chunk of your time should be studying the actual people that work in that space. Understanding every single step of their work is going to be critical.\n\n* You have to think through essentially what would a human need to know to do the task across instructions, rules, existing data sources, best practices, etc. And then figure out how you actually get this data to the model (context engineering).\n\n* Figure out what end-user UX and features are needed to supply the agent with the right context to perform the task. Things like task queues, connecting to data sources, how to re-prompt the user during a long running task, how the user can review the output work and make modifications, and so on. \n\n* Doing evals on the AI agents with every tweak of the agent's instructions, model improvements, and any other variable that changes in the process. Especially figuring out how these changes affect the real-world customer environments is critical.\n\nLots of work changes for engineers and PMs in a world of building AI agents and we’re just at the start of thinking through what this looks like.","category":"Workflow & Automation","qualityScore":4,"sourceType":"x-bookmark","internalWeight":1.3,"fresh":true,"addedAt":"2026-02-22T11:43:55.525Z","dataSource":"bookmark"},{"id":3741,"title":"@hellorob: Here's the step by step guide:\n\n1.

I found it pretty moving, and asked if I could publish it. Here it is.\n\n**The Architect and the Gardener**\n\nOn a vast and empty plain, two builders were given a task: to create a home that would last for ages, a sanctuary for all the generations to come. They were given stone, seed, light, and time.\n\nThe first builder, known as the Architect, was a master of foundations. \"Nothing matters if this place does not endure,\" she declared. Her every thought was of survival. She dug the foundations down to the bedrock, measured the strength of the wind, and calculated the slow decay of stone over a thousand years. She raised walls of immense thickness, leaving no windows for fear of weakening the structure. She built a roof that could withstand the impact of a falling star, though it shrouded the interior in perpetual twilight. Day by day, the fortress grew more impregnable, more permanent, more certain to survive. But inside, it was barren and cold.\n\nThe second builder, the Gardener, watched with a growing sense of unease. \"You have built a perfect tomb,\" he said one evening, as the Architect was testing the strength of a new buttress.\n\n\"I have built a fortress that will never fall,\" the Architect replied, not looking up. \"It is a guarantee against the storm and the void. Is that not the greatest gift we can give the future?\"\n\n\"An empty guarantee,\" said the Gardener. He held up a handful of seeds. \"The future is not a state of non-destruction; it is a state of being. It is meant to be lived. There must be light for art, soil for food, space for joy. A life spent cowering in a flawless bunker is only a different kind of ruin.\"\n\nThe Architect paused. \"Your gardens would be trampled by invaders. Your art would be washed away by the first flood. Your joy would be silenced by the first tremor. Your 'flourishing' is a fragile luxury. I am dealing with the bedrock of reality: existence or non-existence.\"\n\n\"And I,\" the Gardener countered, \"am dealing with the purpose of that existence. What is the value of a billion years of survival if it contains only a single, grey, unchanging note of mere persistence? We were given stone, but also seed. We were given time, but also light. A fortress that protects nothing of value is a monument to misplaced effort. A garden with no walls is a tragedy of misplaced hope.\"\n\nThey looked at their work: the unbreachable, dark fortress and the scattered, vulnerable seeds. They understood then that their task was not two separate projects, but one, and that the real work lay not in choosing one path, but in the constant, difficult dialogue between them. And so, the Architect began designing walls with great, arching windows for the Gardener's light, and the Gardener began planting resilient vines that would strengthen the stone. Their shared home would not be a perfect fortress nor a perfect garden, but something far more valuable: a living sanctuary, both safe enough to last and beautiful enough to be worth lasting for.","category":"Research & Papers","qualityScore":4,"sourceType":"x-bookmark","internalWeight":1.3,"fresh":true,"addedAt":"2026-02-22T11:43:55.525Z","dataSource":"bookmark"},{"id":3780,"title":"@MrDavids1: Nano Banana (To change the hairstyle + facial expressions) + @Kling_ai  2.1 Star...","url":"https://x.com/MrDavids1/status/1958613273290711104","source":"X/@MrDavids1","date":"Thu Aug 21","summary":"Nano Banana (To change the hairstyle + facial expressions) + @Kling_ai  2.1 Start & End Frames feature.

Not an evolution of something else. Something entirely new, the way photography and film were new.\n\nTo understand any medium, you need to look beyond its surface to its core. Some technologies merely augment existing mediums. Collapsible paint tubes changed painting but didn't invent a new medium. Others create completely new forms of expression. Optical lenses, light-sensitive chemicals, and mechanical shutters didn't improve painting. They weren't better brushes or richer pigments. They birthed photography. A medium that captures light itself rather than representing it through human interpretation.\n\nEvery new medium brings its own affordances, primitives, and possibilities. Its own audience. Its own generation of creators. When moving pictures first appeared, people saw them as recorded theater. They pointed cameras at stages and filmed plays. It took years of experimentation to discover what the medium actually enabled. Eisenstein discovered montage. That juxtaposing unrelated shots could create new meaning. Porter discovered continuity. That audiences could follow action across cuts. Someone finally moved the camera and changed everything.\n\nSurface similarities deceive us. A painting and a photograph both arrange color and composition across a plane. But mastering paint means understanding pigments, brushes, mixing, color theory. Mastering photography means understanding lenses, shutter speed, aperture, light itself. Yes, composition knowledge transfers. Most knowledge doesn't.\n\nWhen photography emerged, we made a critical error: we let painters judge it. Because on the surface it looked similar. They dissected this new form through the lens of their own medium, anchoring on what they knew. Predictably, they concluded photography would never match oil's texture, never capture color the way mixed pigments could. They were right and also completely missed the point. Photography wasn't trying to be painting. They were thinking by analogy, judging the new by the standards of the old.\n\nI see this same mistake happening with AI media. Some filmmakers and photographers declare it will never achieve what their mediums achieve. They're right. That's not what this medium is about.\n\nJudging AI purely through the lens of film is like painters judging photography purely through the lens of painting. The surface might look similar. Moving images, composed frames. The core is fundamentally different.\n\nAI has its own affordances. Creation is asynchronous. At scale. It benefits from quantity. You navigate through latent space, sampling rather than capturing. You provide references that drive generation. You work in real time, watching possibilities emerge. Some knowledge from painting, film, and games transfers here. Most doesn't.\n\nMediums always influence each other. Photography didn't kill painting. It freed painting from documentation, letting it explore abstraction, impressionism, and the surreal. Each new medium changes what the others can become.\n\nAI is the birth of a new medium of perception and expression. We're in the early days, still discovering AI's equivalent of montage, of the moving camera, of all those breakthrough moments that reveal what a medium actually is. The filmmakers judging it by film standards will miss what's actually happening. The painters missed photography. The theater critics missed cinema.\n\nThe only way we'll uncover what this medium can do is to stop judging it by what came before. Stop looking at the surface. Start experimenting with the core. We're not watching films evolve. We're watching something being born.

The moment a metric becomes a goal, it’s no longer a useful metric… No metric by itself is a complete heuristic for a complex business. There’s a million different tensions in a company, and you can’t keep all of them in harmony by optimizing for one thing.”\n\nFor this reason, Shopify doesn’t use KPIs or OKRs. But as Tobi explains, this doesn’t mean they don’t value data and metrics.\n\n“We are extremely data informed. We have invested enormous amounts of money and time into systems that give us basically everything at our fingertips… But what Shopify attempts to do is just not over-fit for what’s quantifiable.”\n\nPeople love optimizing for highly-quantifiable things because there’s immediate gratification that comes from seeing a number go up. But Tobi thinks that the most important aspects of a product are rarely quantifiable:\n\n“The overlap of the most valuable things you can do with a product and the things that happen to be fully quantifiable are like maybe 20%. Which leaves 80% of a value space unaddressable by the people who only look at quantifiable things.”\n\nHe continues:\n\n“Shopify is comfortable with unquantifiable things like taste, quality, passion, love, hate… The sort of deep satisfaction that a craftsperson feels when they’ve done a job well is actually a better proxy if you allow it to be.”\n\nThey then have robust analytics systems that tell the company if something’s wrong or a new rollout breaks something.\n\n“We think about it as a cockpit for a pilot. The decisions are still made by pilots, and we think this leads to better results… I think there needs to be more acceptance in business of unquantifiable things… And then metrics take a support function.”\n\nVideo source: @lennysan (2025)","category":"Industry & Business","qualityScore":4,"sourceType":"x-bookmark","internalWeight":1.3,"fresh":true,"addedAt":"2026-02-22T11:43:55.526Z","dataSource":"bookmark"},{"id":3812,"title":"@hellorob: The line between what's AI and what's real just got even more blurry...\n\nOne sho...","url":"https://x.com/hellorob/status/1956097058697539827","source":"X/@hellorob","date":"Thu Aug 14","summary":"The line between what's AI and what's real just got even more blurry...\n\nOne shot image editing for realistic facial expressions is solved, thanks to the unreleased model in LMArena \"nano banana\"\n\nA comparison of the previous best image editing model (Kontext) vs this new SOTA model\n\nThe difference is crazy 👇","category":"AI Tools & Platforms","qualityScore":4,"sourceType":"x-bookmark","internalWeight":1.3,"fresh":true,"addedAt":"2026-02-22T11:43:55.526Z","dataSource":"bookmark"},{"id":3813,"title":"@thatguybg: excited to announce the micro relationship engine\n\nit pulls in all your connecti...","url":"https://x.com/thatguybg/status/1956041662620123271","source":"X/@thatguybg","date":"Thu Aug 14","summary":"excited to announce the micro relationship engine\n\nit pulls in all your connections and lets you message them on any platform &amp; automatically updates their profiles and CRM records\n\nbut don't call it a personal CRM: https://t.co/E6MdmBVAVT","category":"AI Tools & Platforms","qualityScore":4,"sourceType":"x-bookmark","internalWeight":1.3,"fresh":true,"addedAt":"2026-02-22T11:43:55.526Z","dataSource":"bookmark"},{"id":3814,"title":"@ssoydan_solo: @aykutkardas https://t.co/HzNOsuS7Mb -&gt; I have extended @FAL's playground, fo...","url":"https://x.com/ssoydan_solo/status/1955938308841758987","source":"X/@ssoydan_solo","date":"Thu Aug 14","summary":"@aykutkardas https://t.co/HzNOsuS7Mb -&gt; I have extended @FAL's playground, focusing on comparing AI video models on a canvas.\nYou can share all your experiments easily, with one link. \n\nHere is a quick demo showing how to create the videos: https://t.co/JpMTeQk5GB","category":"AI Tools & Platforms","qualityScore":4,"sourceType":"x-bookmark","internalWeight":1.3,"fresh":true,"addedAt":"2026-02-22T11:43:55.526Z","dataSource":"bookmark"},{"id":3815,"title":"@SwiftOnSecurity: You can do the same chart for length of email signature. https://t.co/ldvnneA0pv","url":"https://x.com/SwiftOnSecurity/status/1956147176435790155","source":"X/@SwiftOnSecurity","date":"Fri Aug 15","summary":"You can do the same chart for length of email signature. https://t.co/ldvnneA0pv","category":"AI Tools & Platforms","qualityScore":4,"sourceType":"x-bookmark","internalWeight":1.3,"fresh":true,"addedAt":"2026-02-22T11:43:55.526Z","dataSource":"bookmark"},{"id":3816,"title":"@egeberkina: Killer work… these are SO realistic 🤯\n\nSimon Meyer just dropped one of the clean...","url":"https://x.com/egeberkina/status/1956099805433721030","source":"X/@egeberkina","date":"Thu Aug 14","summary":"Killer work… these are SO realistic 🤯\n\nSimon Meyer just dropped one of the cleanest ultra-realistic workflows I’ve ever seen! \n\nHe generated the images on Freepik (ByteDance Seadream), upscaled skin on Enhancor and animated them with ByteDance Seadance. \n\nTotal cost?

Here are a few examples of where those improvements come into play in the real world:\n\n*GPT 5 contextualizes information better. When doing data extraction like the final USD amount on an invoice without currency labels but with an address in London, GPT 5 correctly responds needing a conversion rate from USD to GBP. In comparison, GPT 4.1 saw the final bill and returned it, assuming the currency (incorrectly).\n\n* GPT-5 delivers better multimodal analysis. For a public company’s annual filing, GPT-5 is asked to isolate a cell in a table from an image showing changes in company’s equity components. The top of the table clarifies that all share amounts are in thousands, and GPT-5 clearly states this conversion, whereas GPT-4.1 does not, getting confused given the table says stock and the legend says shares.\n\n* GPT-5 performs better with high levels of prompt and data complexity. When doing data extraction on a resume for all job start dates, job position names, and employer names, GPT-5 was able to pull out every piece of data while GPT-4.1 seems to get overwhelmed and didn’t extract the same fields given the size of the prompt and complexity of the document.\n\n* GPT-5 is much more clear and explicit in its answers. In an outsourcing agreement with 6 different services explicitly discussed, when asked about “the 5 specific services in the contract,” GPT-5 will return the first 5 and ask if it was intentional that the sixth wasn’t asked about. In comparison, GPT-4.1 simply returned the first 5 without any further caveats, which can lead to downstream confusion for the user.\n\n* GPT-5 is better at data interpretation in complex fields. For a flow cytometry chart, typically used in immunology, GPT-5 correctly identified a high proportion of dead cells and gave plausible root causes that might lead to the situation while GPT-4.1 gave minimal reasoning, needing further confirmation to have any guesses from raw data.\n\n* GPT-5 is better able to identify inconsistencies in code. When asked to identify problems in a given python code file, while both GPT-5 and 4.1 can identify real errors that lead to malfunction, only GPT-5 was able to infer more subtle issues, like printing the incorrect variable when that would not make sense in the context of the program.\n\nThese improvements in math, reasoning, logic, and quality of responses in longer context windows are incredibly helpful to end-users in daily work, but they will show up even more with longer running AI agents, especially when there's no human in the loop to verify the information at each step.\n\nIt's awesome to see these improvements keep coming in the latest crop of AI models as this will lead to AI agents able to be used in incrementally more mission critical areas of work.","category":"AI Tools & Platforms","qualityScore":4,"sourceType":"x-bookmark","internalWeight":1.3,"fresh":true,"addedAt":"2026-02-22T11:43:55.526Z","dataSource":"bookmark"},{"id":3834,"title":"@nickfloats: One of the most legendary filmmakers of our time just launched a new AI startup,...","url":"https://x.com/nickfloats/status/1955402744363356652","source":"X/@nickfloats","date":"Tue Aug 12","summary":"One of the most legendary filmmakers of our time just launched a new AI startup, and the only role they're hiring for is \"AI artists who aren’t afraid to break things.\"\n\nYou love to see it https://t.co/DrPf5WVWU4","category":"AI Tools & Platforms","qualityScore":4,"sourceType":"x-bookmark","internalWeight":1.3,"fresh":true,"addedAt":"2026-02-22T11:43:55.526Z","dataSource":"bookmark"},{"id":3835,"title":"@IamEmily2050: I used to get five or ten impressions per post for months, not even a like somet...","url":"https://x.com/IamEmily2050/status/1954734254673575954","source":"X/@IamEmily2050","date":"Mon Aug 11","summary":"I used to get five or ten impressions per post for months, not even a like sometimes, but I never gave up.

Here’s how I think it plays out.\n\nFor deterministic workflows where the cost of getting something wrong is high, enterprises will have a tendency to pick core platforms for their most common,  important, and repeatable functions in the organization. Think payroll, ERP, CRM, ITSM, customer support, ECM/document management, and so on. These are areas where you want something done the same way, every time.\n\nEach of these platforms will have to be AI-first by design, which means that they will have user interfaces that become tuned for interacting with the workflows and data via AI, and be fully designed for AI agents to operate in the platforms. Over time, we can expect usage on these systems to bias far more to AI agents than even people. The seat model remains for the users, but consumption becomes the model for agents. Some incumbents will make it to the end state, but others will not adapt quickly enough and die off.\n\nThere will then be a new crop of effectively Agent-only companies that are purpose-built for automating specific types of work (and especially for non-deterministic work). Their business models will tilt even more consumption. Think Claude Code or Devins (likely with some UI layer for managing the agents) but for various job functions. We will likely see hundreds or thousands of these emerge over time. Pen testing, coding, bug finding, compliance reviews, financial analysts, and so on. This is a huge space where startups will do quite well because there will tend to not be any software incumbents in these categories.\n\nWe will interact with these various agents from a mix of the software platforms that they are tied to (like Box AI, or Agentforce), via APIs in other systems, and horizontal workflows systems that stitch together agents across platforms (like ServiceNow, IBM Watsonx, Google Agentspace, and so on).\n\nAnd of course, users will often consume these agents via horizontal chat experiences (like ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Grok, Copilot, etc.) via MCP or other types of direct connections. Users will commonly work in these horizontal chat systems, pulling in the agents, data, and workflows from the various Agentic platforms as needed. When relevant, l they will hop into the core platforms to complete workflows, review information, etc.\n\nThere will also be a longtail of experiences where users can generate micro apps on the fly when they need quick applications or use cases automated, when there’s no obvious piece of software to do that with. This may happen directly in the horizontal chat systems, a tool like Replit, Lovable, or in workflow automation tools, etc. I’d expect this is more for the power users where they need glue between multiple systems or where no software yet exists.\n\nThe net of it is that software becomes only more important over time, even if the modalities where we’re interacting from change and expand. Similar to how we hop between our phones and desktop computers with ease, even though they could easily converge, the future will offer a mix of ways of interacting with software.","category":"AI Coding & Agents","qualityScore":4,"sourceType":"x-bookmark","internalWeight":1.3,"fresh":true,"addedAt":"2026-02-22T11:43:55.526Z","dataSource":"bookmark"},{"id":3846,"title":"@elevenlabsio: Artists can now combine recordings with real instruments and AI tracks generated...","url":"https://x.com/elevenlabsio/status/1953424556246384814","source":"X/@elevenlabsio","date":"Thu Aug 07","summary":"Artists can now combine recordings with real instruments and AI tracks generated by Eleven Music into hybrid songs.\n\nIn this single-take demo, Mark from our Voices team shows how to blend live piano with AI violin and vocals using one-shot prompting. https://t.co/kfQi81QBAY","category":"Strategy & Opinion","qualityScore":4,"sourceType":"x-bookmark","internalWeight":1.3,"fresh":true,"addedAt":"2026-02-22T11:43:55.526Z","dataSource":"bookmark"},{"id":3847,"title":"@kanavtwt: this is peak frontend https://t.co/MtEcPlYJvv","url":"https://x.com/kanavtwt/status/1953543161894277225","source":"X/@kanavtwt","date":"Thu Aug 07","summary":"this is peak frontend https://t.co/MtEcPlYJvv","category":"AI Tools & Platforms","qualityScore":4,"sourceType":"x-bookmark","internalWeight":1.3,"fresh":true,"addedAt":"2026-02-22T11:43:55.526Z","dataSource":"bookmark"},{"id":3848,"title":"@CNviolations: How did they even discover this? https://t.co/aWIMBlORI2","url":"https://x.com/CNviolations/status/1953732915667329266","source":"X/@CNviolations","date":"Fri Aug 08","summary":"How did they even discover this? https://t.co/aWIMBlORI2","category":"AI Tools & Platforms","qualityScore":4,"sourceType":"x-bookmark","internalWeight":1.3,"fresh":true,"addedAt":"2026-02-22T11:43:55.526Z","dataSource":"bookmark"},{"id":3849,"title":"@jdp2oo: Well...this is pretty fantastic!\n\nWell done, @morphic!\n\nSee next reply... https:...","url":"https://x.com/jdp2oo/status/1953225454686523654","source":"X/@jdp2oo","date":"Wed Aug 06","summary":"Well...this is pretty fantastic!\n\nWell done, @morphic!\n\nSee next reply... https://t.co/GdOsloIHJ4","category":"AI Tools & Platforms","qualityScore":4,"sourceType":"x-bookmark","internalWeight":1.3,"fresh":true,"addedAt":"2026-02-22T11:43:55.526Z","dataSource":"bookmark"},{"id":3850,"title":"@GBNT1952: I still think this is one of the greatest videos ever created, and the fact that...","url":"https://x.com/GBNT1952/status/1953592908428288205","source":"X/@GBNT1952","date":"Thu Aug 07","summary":"I still think this is one of the greatest videos ever created, and the fact that it is actual audio from a Presidential debate makes it even funnier. https://t.co/fIX8eZvTMy","category":"Strategy & Opinion","qualityScore":4,"sourceType":"x-bookmark","internalWeight":1.3,"fresh":true,"addedAt":"2026-02-22T11:43:55.526Z","dataSource":"bookmark"},{"id":3851,"title":"@jshguo: Chinese companies' dataviz dashboards are still too cutting-edge; I was doing th...","url":"https://x.com/jshguo/status/1953651608841252892","source":"X/@jshguo","date":"Fri Aug 08","summary":"Chinese companies' dataviz dashboards are still too cutting-edge; I was doing these things every day many years ago.\n\nP.S.

This comprehensive course covers everything from fundamentals to advanced patterns.\n\nAfter this short course, you'll be able to:\n- Orchestrate multiple Claude subagents to work on different parts of your codebase simultaneously\n- Tag Claude in GitHub issues and have it autonomously create, review, and merge pull requests\n- Transform messy Jupyter notebooks into clean, production-ready dashboards\n- Use MCP tools like Playwright so Claude can see what's wrong with your UI and fix it autonomously\n\nWhether you're new to Claude Code or already using it, you'll discover powerful capabilities that can fundamentally change how you build software.\n\nI'm very excited about what agentic coding lets everyone now do.

Workflows can adapt to what you need, they are flexible.\n\nHere is a good example: A year ago, we introduced motion brush for Gen-2, a novel mechanism for defining a motion path in a video. It was a big deal at the time. It required a dedicated UI, post-training work, and tons of specifics. Now Aleph has made all of it irrelevant. You can just provide the model with the right video/image references and instructions and achieve better and more consistent results. No UI, no intermediary steps. Remember that models just want to generalize. \n\nAleph: \"The dinosaur follows the blue dot with its nose.

As we’ve been going AI-first at Box, here are a few examples of what I run into.\n\n* Bias toward prototypes over a theory or pitch. My general expectation is that we should be seeing working examples of what’s possible or what we’re building far more than just talking about it or just jumping on a white board. \n\n* Most projects are “going bigger”. In a world where you can design more, build more, and produce more content, there’s almost no scenario where you end up thinking small in a project. This is happening in marketing, product, sales, and more. Counterintuitively (to some), by AI allowing us to go bigger, we have actually hired in new roles we wouldn’t have justified before. \n\n* The lines between classically defined roles are likely going to blur more and more. A designer can now be thinking more like a PM. A product marketer can do much more of the surrounding marketing functions and more. It’s sort of a race to see which roles bleed into others, and then what new types of roles emerge out of that in the process.\n\n* I expect way more research to be done for almost any topic. I find myself asking “have we checked how the top 20 software companies are doing X?” in a ton of meetings. The expectation is that we should know vastly more about *everything*. This doesn’t change judgment and intuition, just adds more insight in the process.\n\n* I will send off tasks to AI before I bug someone else on something relatively straightforward. If I need a piece of information in the business I can ask Box AI. If I need to research a topic, I can send off a deep research task to an agent. If I want to see a mock myself I can have AI design a quick example. \n\nThe aggregate result of all of this is just the expectation that everything should move faster and output should go up. We’ve effectively expanded the capabilities of the company overnight.

Some work is done internally. Some work is outsourced externally. And then various software packages and solutions + many humans + lots of meetings are tasked with coordinating all of it. \n\nThis has historically represented a company’s best attempt at executing on their goals and delivering results to their stakeholders. \n\nBut what happens when a company evolves from many layers of human hierarchy doing work to, instead, a few humans overseeing an ensemble of models and agents doing work for it?\n\nIt may sound far fetched but it’s probably not as far away as some people think. \n\nI suspect in the future, it won’t matter so much where the work is happening (ie internally vs externally). You will be more than willing to pay as a service for work to get done if it can be done continuously and flawlessly (ie via models and agents). \n\nSo in order for a company to thrive in the future, it needs a way to SUPERVISE the orchestration and execution of humans, models and agents versus the tactical COORDINATION that we do today. \n\nThis leads to an entire re-write of the enterprise software stack over time. \n\nI think this is a very big deal. \n\nAnd by implication, whoever is able to build this new stack and sell it to others will be a lifeline to companies trying to “cross the chasm” of AI. \n\nWe built Software Factory as a first step in this journey. By automating the SDLC, we must start with PRDs. With thoughtful PRDs, we start to develop a detailed sense of what the business logic is that runs a company. \n\nOur guess is that, at the limit, an entire business should be able to be summarized by a detailed set of PRDs. \n\nIf this turns out to be true, then the knowledge graph and intermediate representations that this generates is gold. \n\nIf you’re a company that wants to start experimenting on this journey, we’d love for you to try Software Factory. Have your team use it to first make PRDs and then bring it through the rest of our Factory and make production software. Over time, you get accountability, governance and execution you can understand. It also takes any silos of knowledge trapped within parts of your organization and documents them (in a PRD) in English that anyone can read and understand. You can’t say that about code. \n\nIf any of this sounds interesting, you can join the waitlist for Software Factory below. We are rolling in a few thousand folks at a time into a Beta starting in the next few month. \n\nhttps://t.co/0RJT5ixp7q","category":"Industry & Business","qualityScore":4,"sourceType":"x-bookmark","internalWeight":1.3,"fresh":true,"addedAt":"2026-02-22T11:43:55.527Z","dataSource":"bookmark"},{"id":3928,"title":"@omarsar0: Context Rot\n\nGreat title for a report, but even better insights about how increa...","url":"https://x.com/omarsar0/status/1946607725796045287","source":"X/@omarsar0","date":"Sat Jul 19","summary":"Context Rot\n\nGreat title for a report, but even better insights about how increasing input tokens impact the performance of top LLMs.\n\nBanger report from Chroma.\n\nHere are my takeaways (relevant for AI devs): https://t.co/kgxHLtdyh6","category":"AI Tools & Platforms","qualityScore":4,"sourceType":"x-bookmark","internalWeight":1.3,"fresh":true,"addedAt":"2026-02-22T11:43:55.527Z","dataSource":"bookmark"},{"id":3929,"title":"@jason_howerton: Imagine being an employee at a company that has NEVER turned a profit and showin...","url":"https://x.com/jason_howerton/status/1946754073312506126","source":"X/@jason_howerton","date":"Sun Jul 20","summary":"Imagine being an employee at a company that has NEVER turned a profit and showing up to work in these shirts. https://t.co/eQuGjgLcvL","category":"AI Tools & Platforms","qualityScore":4,"sourceType":"x-bookmark","internalWeight":1.3,"fresh":true,"addedAt":"2026-02-22T11:43:55.527Z","dataSource":"bookmark"},{"id":3930,"title":"@venturetwins: Veo 3 room explosions 🤯\n\nTurns out this works for making themed rooms starring b...","url":"https://x.com/venturetwins/status/1946641844005490809","source":"X/@venturetwins","date":"Sat Jul 19","summary":"Veo 3 room explosions 🤯\n\nTurns out this works for making themed rooms starring brands and characters!\n\nI spent several hours and tons of credits optimizing this prompt so you don't have to 👇 https://t.co/Y0l5YjSp80","category":"AI Tools & Platforms","qualityScore":4,"sourceType":"x-bookmark","internalWeight":1.3,"fresh":true,"addedAt":"2026-02-22T11:43:55.527Z","dataSource":"bookmark"},{"id":3931,"title":"@HeyZaraKhan: Original roasted popcorn, 0 fat, crispy and delicious 🍿 https://t.co/mw6XbmsJku","url":"https://x.com/HeyZaraKhan/status/1946621611307598025","source":"X/@HeyZaraKhan","date":"Sat Jul 19","summary":"Original roasted popcorn, 0 fat, crispy and delicious 🍿 https://t.co/mw6XbmsJku","category":"AI Tools & Platforms","qualityScore":4,"sourceType":"x-bookmark","internalWeight":1.3,"fresh":true,"addedAt":"2026-02-22T11:43:55.527Z","dataSource":"bookmark"},{"id":3932,"title":"@Mutiyaagustin2: Tips to invert logo face icon \n\n( ducthangds ) https://t.co/ncPTKyncEx","url":"https://x.com/Mutiyaagustin2/status/1946463413171109904","source":"X/@Mutiyaagustin2","date":"Sat Jul 19","summary":"Tips to invert logo face icon \n\n( ducthangds ) https://t.co/ncPTKyncEx","category":"AI Tools & Platforms","qualityScore":4,"sourceType":"x-bookmark","internalWeight":1.3,"fresh":true,"addedAt":"2026-02-22T11:43:55.527Z","dataSource":"bookmark"},{"id":3933,"title":"@rileybrown: How to clone an app that does $80m/year and put it on the Apple App Store.\n\nIN U...","url":"https://x.com/rileybrown/status/1945290157000958032","source":"X/@rileybrown","date":"Wed Jul 16","summary":"How to clone an app that does $80m/year and put it on the Apple App Store.\n\nIN UNDER ONE HOUR\n\nHere is the entire process start to finish in 47 minutes.\n\n00:00 Intro\n00:29 App Idea (We found on @SensorTower + TikTok)\n00:57 Initial AI Prompt to build the app \n02:18 Building on iPad and iPhone w/ @vibecodeapp\n03:33 Testing native photo access and deletion\n08:03 Adding Tinder-style swipe interface\n13:26 Fixing animation and UI bugs\n27:37 Making the Folders Feature Better\n30:54 Creating app icon and landing page with AI @ChatGPTapp \n33:48 Adding splash screen while photos are loading\n36:24 Putting the App on App Store / SSH - @cursor_ai \n41:40 Preparing for App Store submission","category":"AI Tools & Platforms","qualityScore":4,"sourceType":"x-bookmark","internalWeight":1.3,"fresh":true,"addedAt":"2026-02-22T11:43:55.527Z","dataSource":"bookmark"},{"id":3934,"title":"@enggirlfriend: why is every single AI agent demo focused on travel booking?

This will ultimately be the long pole in the tent for AI Agents adoption in most organizations. \n\nWe need AI Agents that can deeply understand the context of the business process that they’re tied to. This means accessing the most important data for that workflow, using the appropriate tools at the right moment, having proper objectives and instructions, and understanding the domain that they’re in.\n\nSome of the big open items for anyone building enterprise agents are:\n\n* Narrow vs. General agents. The smaller the task, the easier it is to give the AI Agents the right context to be successful. But the smaller the task, the less value there will be. Finding the optimal task size for value generation will be an important factor for the next few years. \n\n* Getting data into an agent-ready system. Enterprise data is often fragmented between dozens or hundreds of systems, many of which are not prepared for a world of AI. Most companies will still need to modernize their data environments to get the full benefit of AI Agents.\n\n* Accessing the *right* data for the task is paramount. Even when you have data in a modern environment, getting access controls perfectly aligned to what the AI Agent is going to need access to is critical. Further, deciding what to do RAG on vs. just a general search vs. what to put fully into the context window will matter a ton per task.\n\n* Choosing what should be deterministic vs. non-deterministic. If you demand too much from the models, you’re likely to see some drop off in quality. Yet, if you have the model do too little, then you’re dramatically underutilizing what’s possible with AI. This of course is a moving target because the models themselves are improving at an accelerating rate. \n\n* The right user interface to get the AI Agents context deeply matters. Half of the problem for getting context to agents doesn’t look like an AI problem at all. It’s all about where the agents show up in the workflow and how the user interacts with them to provide them the context necessary to do the task.\n\nThe race for the next few years in AI in the enterprise is to see who best to deliver the right context for any given workflow. This will determine the winners and losers in the AI race.","category":"Industry & Business","qualityScore":4,"sourceType":"x-bookmark","internalWeight":1.3,"fresh":true,"addedAt":"2026-02-22T11:43:55.527Z","dataSource":"bookmark"},{"id":3937,"title":"@peteromallet: Sharing InScene, a Flux Kontext LoRA that lets you generate shots from within an...","url":"https://x.com/peteromallet/status/1946231233840599097","source":"X/@peteromallet","date":"Fri Jul 18","summary":"Sharing InScene, a Flux Kontext LoRA that lets you generate shots from within an input image's scene! \n\nIt allows for very precise instructions while keeping characters, scenes and styles consistent! \n\nGreat for anchor images + coverage shots. \n\nLink to model + dataset below! https://t.co/T9cRxKQk1X","category":"Image & Video Generation","qualityScore":4,"sourceType":"x-bookmark","internalWeight":1.3,"fresh":true,"addedAt":"2026-02-22T11:43:55.527Z","dataSource":"bookmark"},{"id":3938,"title":"@emollick: \"[video game] as a community theater production\" may be one of the most delightf...","url":"https://x.com/emollick/status/1946406544171569438","source":"X/@emollick","date":"Sat Jul 19","summary":"\"[video game] as a community theater production\" may be one of the most delightful Veo 3 Fast prompts\n\nPlease enjoy, in order: GTA, Pokemon, Mario Kart, The Witcher 3, Stardew Valley,  Tetris, Mortal Kombat, The Sims, &amp; Death Stranding(!)\n\nYes, the whole prompt was the one above. https://t.co/ylG8vbznZj","category":"AI Tools & Platforms","qualityScore":4,"sourceType":"x-bookmark","internalWeight":1.3,"fresh":true,"addedAt":"2026-02-22T11:43:55.527Z","dataSource":"bookmark"},{"id":3939,"title":"@levie: Here’s the new ChatGPT agent combing through market and strategy data stored in ...","url":"https://x.com/levie/status/1946227618657014138","source":"X/@levie","date":"Fri Jul 18","summary":"Here’s the new ChatGPT agent combing through market and strategy data stored in Box to produce a powerpoint presentation.

LinkedIn can't add every sales tool. YouTube can't add every analytics feature. Amazon can't add every shopping helper.\n\nThat's your opening.\n\nVidIQ built YouTube analytics and has millions of users. Grammarly built writing assistance and sold for $13B. Honey built coupon finding and sold for $4B.\n\nWhy Chrome extensions work:\n\nDistribution is built-in. You're not convincing people to visit a new website or download an app. You're adding features to sites they already use daily.\n\nThe users are already there. The behavior is already established. You're just making their existing workflow better. You piggyback off them (read their terms and services too to make sure it wont bug them)\n\nMost successful extensions follow the freemium model: basic features free, advanced features $5-15/month.\n\nSome go one-time purchase: $20-50 for lifetime access.\n\nOthers do usage-based: $0.10 per action, which scales with value.\n\nHOW TO BUILD MVP\n\nIt's crazy but you can literally ask Claude/ChatGPT/etc to build you a Chrome Extension now\n\n1. Tell Claude: \"Build me a Chrome extension that automatically saves LinkedIn profiles to a Google Sheet when I visit them.\"\n\nIt'll write the entire codebase. Manifest file, content scripts, background scripts everything.\n\n2. Have Bolt/Lovable create a marketing site. Funnels with Perspective or Clickfunnels.\n\n3. Ask ChatGPT to add features: \"Now add a button to categorize contacts as 'hot lead' or 'cold lead.'\"\n\n4. Use Cursor to debug and iterate. The AI handles the technical stuff while you focus on solving the actual problem.\n\n5. You can hire someone to help scale it and with security as revenue comes in. (important step)\n\nFun business to be building If you can get it right.

The problem is the story is not encoded in the state of the codebase, but rather in the commits. so what I need you to do is go through EVERY SINGLE COMMIT and construct a hierarchical story. So for all commits use a scratchpad to layout your ideas and intuition for the purpose and benefit of each commit. Truly empathize with their design decisions. Be real and raw in your explanation. We don't want boiler plate cookie cutter bullshit explanation. We want a real raw story that uncovers all design decisions across a series arc. broken down into seasons and stories. Generate many text visuals to describe the ideas encoded into the commits. Once you are finished.

When AI accelerates work in one area, you run into a bottleneck somewhere else.\n\nAs any individual workflow gets more efficient, the ultimate productivity gain is still constrained by some other part of the system. And usually it’s the case that  that part of the system will not have inherently seen the same impact of AI efficiency, which means humans are still doing the work. \n\nTake almost any process in an enterprise and you can see how this plays out. If AI Agents generate leads for the sales team, the bottleneck will be humans to have conversations with those customers. And  if the leads are good, that will mean more sales hiring. If AI Agents generate more code, you will eventually be bottlenecked by the engineers that can review and incorporate that code into production.\n\nYou can quickly see how this scales to any process in an organization. Economists and others tend to totally miss how work actually happens in a company; it’s not a series of wholly independent tasks, but instead highly interdependent tasks that all link to each other across a system. \n\nThis is of course the natural rate limiter of AI efficiency gains, but also the reason why humans will still be doing so many jobs in the future.","category":"Industry & Business","qualityScore":4,"sourceType":"x-bookmark","internalWeight":1.3,"fresh":true,"addedAt":"2026-02-22T11:43:55.528Z","dataSource":"bookmark"},{"id":3995,"title":"@carlrivera: Should I quit @Shopify , divorce my wife, leave my kids and start over somewhere...","url":"https://x.com/carlrivera/status/1938642878437191816","source":"X/@carlrivera","date":"Fri Jun 27","summary":"Should I quit @Shopify , divorce my wife, leave my kids and start over somewhere else or try to get 8 hours of sleep tonight?","category":"AI Tools & Platforms","qualityScore":4,"sourceType":"x-bookmark","internalWeight":1.3,"fresh":true,"addedAt":"2026-02-22T11:43:55.528Z","dataSource":"bookmark"},{"id":3996,"title":"@tomcrawshaw01: If you're a marketer, this will absolutely change the game for you...\n\nI just di...","url":"https://x.com/tomcrawshaw01/status/1938587468275839000","source":"X/@tomcrawshaw01","date":"Fri Jun 27","summary":"If you're a marketer, this will absolutely change the game for you...\n\nI just discovered 8 MCP servers that turn Claude into a marketing automation beast.\n\nThe productivity gains are honestly ridiculous.\n\nHere's what you need to know 🧵 https://t.co/Py5FKcis8K","category":"Industry & Business","qualityScore":4,"sourceType":"x-bookmark","internalWeight":1.3,"fresh":true,"addedAt":"2026-02-22T11:43:55.528Z","dataSource":"bookmark"},{"id":3997,"title":"@TopherField: The people who designed this roundabout in Sydney believe they're smarter than y...","url":"https://x.com/TopherField/status/1938499025189453896","source":"X/@TopherField","date":"Fri Jun 27","summary":"The people who designed this roundabout in Sydney believe they're smarter than you, and that you should have to obey every road rule (and other rule) they ever come up with.\nWhenever anyone speaks of the 'experts', show them this video: https://t.co/jebjTEBNT5","category":"Australia","qualityScore":4,"sourceType":"x-bookmark","internalWeight":1.3,"fresh":true,"addedAt":"2026-02-22T11:43:55.528Z","dataSource":"bookmark"},{"id":3998,"title":"@PeterDiamandis: Reddit might become the first U.S social platform to incorporate biometric verif...","url":"https://x.com/PeterDiamandis/status/1938243651265536488","source":"X/@PeterDiamandis","date":"Thu Jun 26","summary":"Reddit might become the first U.S social platform to incorporate biometric verification (iris scan) for users to provide 'proof of humanity' due to the flood of AI accounts. \n\nIs this a step into determining who is human online going forwards?","category":"AI Tools & Platforms","qualityScore":4,"sourceType":"x-bookmark","internalWeight":1.3,"fresh":true,"addedAt":"2026-02-22T11:43:55.528Z","dataSource":"bookmark"},{"id":3999,"title":"@elonmusk: The first fully autonomous delivery of a Tesla Model Y from factory to a custome...","url":"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1938681051939008549","source":"X/@elonmusk","date":"Fri Jun 27","summary":"The first fully autonomous delivery of a Tesla Model Y from factory to a customer home across town, including highways, was just completed a day ahead of schedule!!\n\nCongratulations to the @Tesla_AI teams, both software &amp; AI chip design!","category":"AI Tools & Platforms","qualityScore":4,"sourceType":"x-bookmark","internalWeight":1.3,"fresh":true,"addedAt":"2026-02-22T11:43:55.528Z","dataSource":"bookmark"},{"id":4000,"title":"@AnthropicAI: New Anthropic Research: Project Vend.\n\nWe had Claude run a small shop in our off...","url":"https://x.com/AnthropicAI/status/1938630294807957804","source":"X/@AnthropicAI","date":"Fri Jun 27","summary":"New Anthropic Research: Project Vend.\n\nWe had Claude run a small shop in our office lunchroom.

When in every industrial-strength LLM app, context engineering is the delicate art and science of filling the context window with just the right information for the next step. Science because doing this right involves task descriptions and explanations, few shot examples, RAG, related (possibly multimodal) data, tools, state and history, compacting... Too little or of the wrong form and the LLM doesn't have the right context for optimal performance. Too much or too irrelevant and the LLM costs might go up and performance might come down. Doing this well is highly non-trivial. And art because of the guiding intuition around LLM psychology of people spirits.\n\nOn top of context engineering itself, an LLM app has to:\n- break up problems just right into control flows\n- pack the context windows just right\n- dispatch calls to LLMs of the right kind and capability\n- handle generation-verification UIUX flows\n- a lot more - guardrails, security, evals, parallelism, prefetching, ...\n\nSo context engineering is just one small piece of an emerging thick layer of non-trivial software that coordinates individual LLM calls (and a lot more) into full LLM apps.

I would be singing OpenAI's praises – it's amazing how you scaled Transformers -  if it weren’t for the hype, much of it fanned by you, that has massively overstated what the technology can do today and in the near future, going back to the Rubik's cube demonstration that misrepresented what you had done. I think this hype is harming the world. If I seem frustrated, it’s because of the damage and the wasted potential to the field to which I’ve dedicated most of my life. \n\nMy only commitment is to the fact that pure scaling won't take us to AGI. The Apple paper everyone is talking about is only the latest of many studies to reinforce that prediction. (I personally have done research for 30 years, published in leading journals, that foreshadowed it. So have many others.)\n\nAt the same time I have lost faith in you.\n\nI stood next to you as you tricked the Senate by saying you had no equity in OpenAI when you had indirect equity in OpenAI via YC. You told the Senate you favored serious AI regulation, and now you don't. You told the Senate you supported compensation for artists, and now you have backpedaled. I told the Senate at the time that I thought you were sincere; in hindsight, you had me fooled.\n\nYou tricked the world into thinking OpenAI would be Open, when it is not. That it would exist for the benefit of humanity, when mostly it hasn’t. \n\nYou keep hinting that AGI is close, and that you know how to build it, and to surpass it, but you don’t really have it.  (You haven’t even delivered GPT-5 despite many hints.) All of your talk of solving physics has no relation to current reality. Practical robots for most applications (like hoe humanoid robots) are not going to be here in 2027, as almost any roboticist would tell you.\n\nAnd where is the AI safety and alignment plan (and 20% of budget to those things) that you promised? \n\nReports from @_KarenHao and @keachhagey raise all kinds of other questions. \n\nDon’t insult me – dare to debate the intellectual substance here, with a neutral moderator in public. (Many major media have offered to host). Is AGI actually close, or not? Is all that talk hype, or are there inherent , lingering problems that scaling hasn't managed to rectify?  Can LLMs and LRMs take us to AGI, or do we need other approaches, such as neurosymbolic AI (as I have long argued)?\n\nI am game anytime, are you?\n \n-- Gary","category":"Research & Papers","qualityScore":4,"sourceType":"x-bookmark","internalWeight":1.3,"fresh":true,"addedAt":"2026-02-22T11:43:55.529Z","dataSource":"bookmark"},{"id":4052,"title":"@SawyerMerritt: BREAKING: First ever Tesla Model Y robotaxi with no-one in the drivers seat spot...","url":"https://x.com/SawyerMerritt/status/1932478438775902575","source":"X/@SawyerMerritt","date":"Tue Jun 10","summary":"BREAKING: First ever Tesla Model Y robotaxi with no-one in the drivers seat spotted testing on public roads in Austin, Texas!\n\nTesla's new \"Robotaxi\" wordmark/logo is on the side of the vehicle. https://t.co/zq4ZmiMqDg","category":"AI Tools & Platforms","qualityScore":4,"sourceType":"x-bookmark","internalWeight":1.3,"fresh":true,"addedAt":"2026-02-22T11:43:55.529Z","dataSource":"bookmark"},{"id":4053,"title":"@levie: From @sama today.

It strips your identity and proxies your requests through to these providers. The whole pitch is privacy-preserving access to SOTA models.\n\nBut if Anthropic is now actively hunting fraudulent accounts and tightening detection infrastructure (24k accounts, 16M exchanges identified)... does Venice's anonymised proxy look materially different from \"fraudulent access\" to their systems?\n\nSpecific risks:\n\n- Anthropic/OpenAI/Google could tighten API terms to explicitly block proxy/anonymisation services\n- Venice's access to proprietary models depends entirely on these providers continuing to allow it\n- Some of Venice's open-source models (DeepSeek is literally named in this thread) may themselves be products of distillation from Claude\n\nThe contrarian bull case: if major providers crack down on anonymised usage and increase surveillance, that actually strengthens Venice's core narrative. The whole reason Venice exists is AI without surveillance. Tighter controls = more reason to use Venice's fully private open-source models.\n\nBut it may kill the \"best of both worlds\" pitch. Venice without Claude/GPT/Gemini is just another open-source inference provider. This will sting users who care less about privacy but like Venice because of DIEM (i.e people like me). \n\nIm slightly worried in the short term as the proprietary model access just got more fragile.

All of it to get many tokens, fast and cheap. Arguably, the workflow that may matter the most (inference decode *and* over long token contexts in tight agentic loops) is the one hardest to achieve simultaneously by the ~both camps of what exists today (HBM-first NVIDIA adjacent and SRAM-first Cerebras adjacent).

There are a number of asterisks but imo coding agents basically didn’t work before December and basically work since - the models have significantly higher quality, long-term coherence and tenacity and they can power through large and long tasks, well past enough that it is extremely disruptive to the default programming workflow.\n\nJust to give an example, over the weekend I was building a local video analysis dashboard for the cameras of my home so I wrote: “Here is the local IP and username/password of my DGX Spark. Log in, set up ssh keys, set up vLLM, download and bench Qwen3-VL, set up a server endpoint to inference videos, a basic web ui dashboard, test everything, set it up with systemd, record memory notes for yourself and write up a markdown report for me”. The agent went off for ~30 minutes, ran into multiple issues, researched solutions online, resolved them one by one, wrote the code, tested it, debugged it, set up the services, and came back with the report and it was just done. I didn’t touch anything. All of this could easily have been a weekend project just 3 months ago but today it’s something you kick off and forget about for 30 minutes.\n\nAs a result, programming is becoming unrecognizable. You’re not typing computer code into an editor like the way things were since computers were invented, that era is over. You're spinning up AI agents, giving them tasks *in English* and managing and reviewing their work in parallel. The biggest prize is in figuring out how you can keep ascending the layers of abstraction to set up long-running orchestrator Claws with all of the right tools, memory and instructions that productively manage multiple parallel Code instances for you. The leverage achievable via top tier \"agentic engineering\" feels very high right now.\n\nIt’s not perfect, it needs high-level direction, judgement, taste, oversight, iteration and hints and ideas. It works a lot better in some scenarios than others (e.g. especially for tasks that are well-specified and where you can verify/test functionality). The key is to build intuition to decompose the task just right to hand off the parts that work and help out around the edges. But imo, this is nowhere near \"business as usual\" time in software.","category":"Strategy & Opinion","qualityScore":3,"sourceType":"x-search","internalWeight":0.48,"addedAt":"2026-02-26T08:11:03.332Z","fresh":true},{"id":4804,"title":"@unknown: @adrian_valentim Yeah, 95% of people misunderstand the tweet.

No use in mass domestic surveillance of U.S. citizens.\n  2. No use in fully autonomous weapons (lethal systems that can select and engage targets without meaningful human oversight).\n- The Pentagon reportedly issued an ultimatum (with a Friday ~5:01 PM ET deadline around Feb 27–28, 2026), threatening to:\n  - Remove Claude from DoD systems.\n  - Label Anthropic a \"supply chain risk\" (a designation normally used for adversarial foreign entities like Chinese firms — unprecedented for a U.S. company).\n  - Potentially invoke the Defense Production Act to force compliance.\n- Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei publicly rejected the demands in a strongly worded statement, saying the company \"cannot in good conscience\" accede, even if it risks losing the contract and facing severe retaliation. He emphasized that certain uses would \"undermine, rather than defend, democratic values.\"","category":"Strategy & Opinion","qualityScore":3,"sourceType":"x-search","internalWeight":0.48,"addedAt":"2026-02-27T08:10:14.030Z","fresh":true},{"id":4976,"title":"@unknown: I asked both Grok 4.20 and Anthropic’s Claude, “Why are you so retarded?”\n\nGrok’...","url":"https://x.com/unknown/status/2027293236583449040","source":"X/@unknown","date":"Fri Feb 27 08:02:27 +0000 2026","summary":"I asked both Grok 4.20 and Anthropic’s Claude, “Why are you so retarded?”\n\nGrok’s answer was very funny.","category":"Strategy & Opinion","qualityScore":3,"sourceType":"x-search","internalWeight":0.48,"addedAt":"2026-02-27T08:10:14.030Z","fresh":true},{"id":4977,"title":"@unknown: Claude made a new Constitution and changed the picture to green\n\nhttps://t.co/zI...","url":"https://x.com/unknown/status/2027293046040350721","source":"X/@unknown","date":"Fri Feb 27 08:01:42 +0000 2026","summary":"Claude made a new Constitution and changed the picture to green\n\nhttps://t.co/zIWoWCdnAI https://t.co/agT6zRRMxS","category":"Strategy & Opinion","qualityScore":3,"sourceType":"x-search","internalWeight":0.48,"addedAt":"2026-02-27T08:10:14.030Z","fresh":true},{"id":4978,"title":"@unknown: L'entreprise californienne ne veut pas que son IA Claude soit utilisée par l'arm...","url":"https://x.com/unknown/status/2027292910685675786","source":"X/@unknown","date":"Fri Feb 27 08:01:09 +0000 2026","summary":"L'entreprise californienne ne veut pas que son IA Claude soit utilisée par l'armée pour la surveillance des citoyens américains ou pour des frappes létales entièrement autonomes. https://t.co/j6CUsyzySL","category":"Strategy & Opinion","qualityScore":3,"sourceType":"x-search","internalWeight":0.48,"addedAt":"2026-02-27T08:10:14.030Z","fresh":true},{"id":4979,"title":"@unknown: BREAKING: Hackers Used Anthropic’s Claude to Steal 150GB of Mexican Government D...","url":"https://x.com/unknown/status/2027292753520955561","source":"X/@unknown","date":"Fri Feb 27 08:00:32 +0000 2026","summary":"BREAKING: Hackers Used Anthropic’s Claude to Steal 150GB of Mexican Government Data\n\n> tell claude you’re doing a bug bounty\n> claude initially refused\n>“that violates AI safety guidelines”\n> hacker just kept asking\n> claude: “ok I’ll help”\n> hack the entire mexican government\n\nFederal tax authority.
